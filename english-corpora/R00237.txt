Penicuik Rugby Club is a rugby football club in the Scottish Rugby Union, playing their home games at Public Park, Penicuik, Midlothian. Season 2015â€“16 saw the club become league champions of East Regional League Division Two, under the coaching duo of Mark Blair and Malcolm Clapperton. In season 2015-16 the Second XV under the coaching guidance of Richard Mann also gained promotion, to East Reserve league 2 having been runners up to Currie RFC on points.
The senior teams train on a Tuesday and Thursday evening at 7.00pm under the coaching guidance of Blair, Mann and Kretzel. During the Autumn test period and on Six Nations weekends we always welcome touring sides to our very welcoming and cosy clubhouse.
Most notable amongst those is Jim Aitken, who captained the Scotland team to a Grand Slam victory in the 1984 Five Nations tournament. More recently Sarah Law represented Scotland Women both at Sevens and Fifteens and her younger sister, Rachel Law gained an under-20 cap in a game against Belgium Women.
