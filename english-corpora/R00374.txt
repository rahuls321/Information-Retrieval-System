Adam Summerfield (born 30 August 1990 in Whitehaven, England) is an English professional ice hockey goaltender, playing for the Manchester Phoenix of the EPL.  Summerfield is a young goaltender who has shown promise at under-18 level and so has been promoted to back-up for the Elite League squad for the 2008/09 season by head coach Tony Hand.
Summerfield showed promise at Under-16 level, playing for the Flintshire Flames, the junior team of the Flintshire Freeze.  This led to his selection for the Under-18 squad of the Manchester Phoenix following trials at the Altrincham Ice Dome.  In his first season with the Phoenix, Summerfield continued to impress, managing a 2.00 GAA in 13 games and claiming a shut-out against the Nottingham Jaguars.  This led to his promotion to the Elite League squad, replacing Aran Fox and Summerfield made his short debut coming on to replace Scott Fankhouser in a 5-2 loss for the Phoenix in Yorkshire against the Sheffield Steelers.  Summerfield continued to make a number of appearances for the rest of the season, but was still employed as back-up.
His continued professionalism and work-rate ensured that Tony Hand re-signed Summerfield for the Phoenix for the 2008/09 season, where he will hope to again make regular EIHL appearances despite his young age.  After again impressing in the close season, Summerfield made a number of substitute appearances for the Phoenix and regularly trained with the Elite League squad.  He was re-signed by the Phoenix to play for the organisation in the 2009/10 season of the EPL.
