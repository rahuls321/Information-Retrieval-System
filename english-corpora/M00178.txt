In logic, conditioned disjunction (sometimes called conditional disjunction) is a ternary logical connective introduced by Church. Given operands p, q, and r, which represent truth-valued propositions, the meaning of the conditioned disjunction [p, q, r] is given by:                    [        p        ,        q        ,        r        ]                 ↔                 (        q        →        p        )        ∧        (        ¬        q        →        r        )              {\displaystyle [p,q,r]~\leftrightarrow ~(q\rightarrow p)\land (\neg q\rightarrow r)}  In words, [p, q, r] is equivalent to: "if q then p, else r", or "p or r, according as q or not q". This may also be stated as "q implies p, and not q implies r". So, for any values of p, q, and r, the value of [p, q, r] is the value of p when q is true, and is the value of r otherwise.The conditioned disjunction is also equivalent to:                    (        q        ∧        p        )        ∨        (        ¬        q        ∧        r        )              {\displaystyle (q\land p)\lor (\neg q\land r)}  and has the same truth table as the "ternary" (?:) operator in many programming languages. In electronic logic terms, it may also be viewed as a single-bit multiplexer.In conjunction with truth constants denoting each truth-value, conditioned disjunction is truth-functionally complete for classical logic. Its truth table is the following:There are other truth-functionally complete  ternary connectives. References  External links  Media related to Conditioned disjunction at Wikimedia Commons
