The Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League (NASL) drafted Rudroff in the first round of the 1977 College Draft.  While he spent most of 1977 with the Sounders reserve team, he did see time in nine first team games after Mel Machin was injured.  His time with the Sounders peaked in 1978 with twenty-three games, but he played only four in 1979.  Following the season, the Sounders traded him and Tommy Ord to the Tulsa Roughnecks in exchange for Jack Brand, Roger Davies and David Nish.  Rudroff did not sign with the Roughnecks, but with the Hartford Hellions of the Major Indoor Soccer League.  When the Hellions moved to Memphis in 1981, Rudroff went with the team, which was renamed the Memphis Americans.

Rudroff earned two caps with the U.S. national team.  Both came in losses to the USSR.  The first was a 3-1 loss on February 3, 1979.  The second was a 4-1 loss on February 11, 1979.
