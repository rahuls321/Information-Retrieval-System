In mathematics, the determinant is a scalar value that is a function of the entries of a square matrix. It allows characterizing some properties of the matrix and the linear map represented by the matrix. In particular, the determinant is nonzero if and only if the matrix is invertible and the linear map represented by the matrix is an isomorphism. The determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants (the preceding property is a corollary of this one).The determinant of a matrix A is denoted det(A), det A, or |A|.In the case of a 2 × 2 matrix the determinant can be defined as                                                                                          |                                A

 Each determinant of a 2 × 2 matrix in this equation is called a minor of the matrix A.  This procedure can be extended to give a recursive definition for the determinant of an n × n matrix, known as Laplace expansion.Determinants occur throughout mathematics. For example, a matrix is often used to represent the coefficients in a system of linear equations, and determinants can be used to solve these equations (Cramer's rule), although other methods of solution are computationally much more efficient. Determinants are used for defining the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, whose roots are the eigenvalues. In geometry, the signed n-dimensional volume of a n-dimensional parallelepiped is expressed by a determinant. This is used in calculus with exterior differential forms and the Jacobian determinant, in particular for changes of variables in multiple integrals. 2 × 2 matrices The determinant of a 2 × 2 matrix                                           (                                                            a                                                  b                                                                              c                                                  d                                                      )                                {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}}   is denoted either by "det" or by vertical bars around the matrix, and is defined as                    det                              (                                                            a                                                  b                                                                              c                                                  d                                                      )                          =                              |                                                            a                                                  b                                                                              c                                                  d                                                      |                          =        a        d        −        b        c        .              {\displaystyle \det {\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{vmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{vmatrix}}=ad-bc.}  For example,                    det                              (                                                            3                                                  7                                                                              1                                                  −                  4                                                      )                          =                              |                                                            3                                                  7                                                                              1                                                                      −                    4                                                                        |                          =        3        ⋅        (        −        4        )        −        7        ⋅        1        =        −        19.              {\displaystyle \det {\begin{pmatrix}3&7\\1&-4\end{pmatrix}}={\begin{vmatrix}3&7\\1&{-4}\end{vmatrix}}=3\cdot (-4)-7\cdot 1=-19.}  = First properties =The determinant has several key properties that can be proved by direct evaluation of the definition for                     2        ×        2              {\displaystyle 2\times 2}  -matrices, and that continue to hold for determinants of larger matrices.

In either case, the images of the basis vectors form a parallelogram that represents the image of the unit square under the mapping.  The parallelogram defined by the rows of the above matrix is the one with vertices at (0, 0), (a, b), (a + c, b + d), and (c, d), as shown in the accompanying diagram.The absolute value of ad − bc is the area of the parallelogram, and thus represents the scale factor by which areas are transformed by A. (The parallelogram formed by the columns of A is in general a different parallelogram, but since the determinant is symmetric with respect to rows and columns, the area will be the same.)The absolute value of the determinant together with the sign becomes the oriented area of the parallelogram. The oriented area is the same as the usual area, except that it is negative when the angle from the first to the second vector defining the parallelogram turns in a clockwise direction (which is opposite to the direction one would get for the identity matrix).To show that ad − bc is the signed area, one may consider a matrix containing two vectors u ≡ (a, b) and v ≡ (c, d) representing the parallelogram's sides. The signed area can be expressed as |u| |v| sin θ for the angle θ between the vectors, which is simply base times height, the length of one vector times the perpendicular component of the other. Due to the sine this already is the signed area, yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the cosine of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector, e.g. u⊥ = (−b, a), so that |u⊥| |v| cos θ′, which can be determined by the pattern of the scalar product to be equal to ad − bc:                              Signed area                =                  |                          u                          |                                  |                          v                          |                        sin                θ        =                  |                                    u                                      ⊥                                |                                  |                      v                    |                        cos                          θ          ′                =                              (                                                            −                  b                                                                              a                                                      )                          ⋅                              (                                                            c                                                                              d                                                      )                          =        a        d        −        b        c        .              {\displaystyle {\text{Signed area}}=|{\boldsymbol {u}}|\,|{\boldsymbol {v}}|\,\sin \,\theta =\left|{\boldsymbol {u}}^{\perp }\right|\,\left|{\boldsymbol {v}}\right|\,\cos \,\theta '={\begin{pmatrix}-b\\a\end{pmatrix}}\cdot {\begin{pmatrix}c\\d\end{pmatrix}}=ad-bc.}  Thus the determinant gives the scaling factor and the orientation induced by the mapping represented by A. When the determinant is equal to one, the linear mapping defined by the matrix is equi-areal and orientation-preserving.The object known as the bivector is related to these ideas. In 2D, it can be interpreted as an oriented plane segment formed by imagining two vectors each with origin (0, 0), and coordinates (a, b) and (c, d). The bivector magnitude (denoted by (a, b) ∧ (c, d)) is the signed area, which is also the determinant ad − bc.If an n × n real matrix A is written in terms of its column vectors                     A        =                  [                                                                                                                a                                                              1                                                                                                                                  a                                                              2                                                                                        ⋯                                                                                            a                                                              n                                                                                                    ]                      {\displaystyle A=\left[{\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}\mathbf {a} _{1}&\mathbf {a} _{2}&\cdots &\mathbf {a} _{n}\end{array}}\right]}  , then                    A                              (                                                            1                                                                              0                                                                              ⋮                                                                              0                                                      )                          =                              a                                1                          ,                A                              (                                                            0                                                                              1                                                                              ⋮                                                                              0                                                      )                          =                              a                                2                          ,                …        ,                A                              (                                                            0                                                                              0                                                                              ⋮                                                                              1                                                      )                          =                              a                                n                          .              {\displaystyle A{\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\\vdots \\0\end{pmatrix}}=\mathbf {a} _{1},\quad A{\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\\vdots \\0\end{pmatrix}}=\mathbf {a} _{2},\quad \ldots ,\quad A{\begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\\vdots \\1\end{pmatrix}}=\mathbf {a} _{n}.}  This means that                     A              {\displaystyle A}   maps the unit n-cube to the n-dimensional parallelotope defined by the vectors                                           a                                1                          ,                              a                                2                          ,        …        ,                              a                                n                          ,              {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} _{1},\mathbf {a} _{2},\ldots ,\mathbf {a} _{n},}   the region                     P        =                  {                                    c                              1                                                                    a                                            1                                      +            ⋯            +                          c                              n                                                                    a                                            n                                      ∣            0            ≤                          c                              i                                      ≤            1                         ∀            i                    }                .              {\displaystyle P=\left\{c_{1}\mathbf {a} _{1}+\cdots +c_{n}\mathbf {a} _{n}\mid 0\leq c_{i}\leq 1\ \forall i\right\}.}  The determinant gives the signed n-dimensional volume of this parallelotope,                     det        (        A        )        =        ±                  vol                (        P        )        ,              {\displaystyle \det(A)=\pm {\text{vol}}(P),}   and hence describes more generally the n-dimensional volume scaling factor of the linear transformation produced by A. (The sign shows whether the transformation preserves or reverses orientation.) In particular, if the determinant is zero, then this parallelotope has volume zero and is not fully n-dimensional, which indicates that the dimension of the image of A is less than n. This means that A produces a linear transformation which is neither onto nor one-to-one, and so is not invertible.

The determinant can also be characterized as the unique function depending on the entries of the matrix satisfying certain properties.

The determinant is multilinear: if the jth column of a matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is written as a linear combination                               a                      j                          =        r        ⋅        v        +        w              {\displaystyle a_{j}=r\cdot v+w}   of two column vectors v and w and a number r, then the determinant of A is expressible as a similar linear combination:                                                                                          |                                A                                  |                                                                            =                                                      |                                                                    a                                      1                                                  ,                …                ,                                  a                                      j                    −                    1                                                  ,                r                ⋅                v                +                w                ,                                  a                                      j                    +                    1                                                  ,                …                ,                                  a                                      n                                                                    |                                                                                                                  =                r                ⋅                                  |                                                  a                                      1                                                  ,                …                ,                v                ,                …                                  a                                      n                                                                    |                                +                                  |                                                  a                                      1                                                  ,                …                ,                w                ,                …                ,                                  a                                      n                                                                    |                                                                          {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}|A|&={\big |}a_{1},\dots ,a_{j-1},r\cdot v+w,a_{j+1},\dots ,a_{n}|\\&=r\cdot |a_{1},\dots ,v,\dots a_{n}|+|a_{1},\dots ,w,\dots ,a_{n}|\end{aligned}}}  The determinant is alternating: whenever two columns of a matrix are identical, its determinant is 0:                              |                          a                      1                          ,        …        ,        v        ,        …        ,        v        ,        …        ,                  a                      n                                    |                =        0.              {\displaystyle |a_{1},\dots ,v,\dots ,v,\dots ,a_{n}|=0.}  If the determinant is defined using the Leibniz formula as above, these three properties can be proved by direct inspection of that formula. Some authors also approach the determinant directly using these three properties: it can be shown that there is exactly one function that assigns to any                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}  -matrix A a number that satisfies these three properties. This also shows that this more abstract approach to the determinant yields the same definition as the one using the Leibniz formula.To see this it suffices to expand the determinant by multi-linearity in the columns into a (huge) linear combination of determinants of matrices in which each column is a standard basis vector. These determinants are either 0 (by property 9) or else ±1 (by properties 1 and 12 below), so the linear combination gives the expression above in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol. While less technical in appearance, this characterization cannot entirely replace the Leibniz formula in defining the determinant, since without it the existence of an appropriate function is not clear.= Immediate consequences =These rules have several further consequences:The determinant is a homogeneous function, i.e.,  (for an                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}   matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}  ).Interchanging any pair of columns of a matrix multiplies its determinant by −1. This follows from the determinant being multilinear and alternating (properties 2 and 3 above):  This formula can be applied iteratively when several columns are swapped. For example  Yet more generally, any permutation of the columns multiplies the determinant by the sign of the permutation.If some column can be expressed as a linear combination of the other columns (i.e. the columns of the matrix form a linearly dependent set), the determinant is 0. As a special case, this includes: if some column is such that all its entries are zero, then the determinant of that matrix is 0.Adding a scalar multiple of one column to another column does not change the value of the determinant. This is a consequence of multilinearity and being alternative: by multilinearity the determinant changes by a multiple of the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns, which determinant is 0, since the determinant is alternating.If                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is a triangular matrix, i.e.                               a                      i            j                          =        0              {\displaystyle a_{ij}=0}  , whenever                     i        >        j              {\displaystyle i>j}   or, alternatively, whenever                     i        <        j              {\displaystyle i<j}  , then its determinant equals the product of the diagonal entries:  Indeed, such a matrix can be reduced, by appropriately adding multiples of the columns with fewer nonzero entries to those with more entries, to a diagonal matrix (without changing the determinant).  For such a matrix, using the linearity in each column reduces to the identity matrix, in which case the stated formula holds by the very first characterizing property of determinants. Alternatively, this formula can also be deduced from the Leibniz formula, since the only permutation                     σ              {\displaystyle \sigma }   which gives a non-zero contribution is the identity permutation. Example These characterizing properties and their consequences listed above are both theoretically significant, but can also be used to compute determinants for concrete matrices. In fact, Gaussian elimination can be applied to bring any matrix into upper triangular form, and the steps in this algorithm affect the determinant in a controlled way. The following concrete example illustrates the computation of the determinant of the matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}   using that method:                    A        =                              [                                                            −                  2                                                  −                  1                                                  2                                                                              2                                                  1                                                  4                                                                              −                  3                                                  3                                                  −                  1                                                      ]                          .              {\displaystyle A={\begin{bmatrix}-2&-1&2\\2&1&4\\-3&3&-1\end{bmatrix}}.}  Combining these equalities gives                               |                A                  |                =        −                  |                E                  |                =        −        (        18        ⋅        3        ⋅        (        −        1        )        )        =        54.              {\displaystyle |A|=-|E|=-(18\cdot 3\cdot (-1))=54.}  = Transpose =The determinant of the transpose of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   equals the determinant of A:                    det                  (                      A                                          T                                              )                =        det        (        A        )              {\displaystyle \det \left(A^{\textsf {T}}\right)=\det(A)}  .This can be proven by inspecting the Leibniz formula. This implies that in all the properties mentioned above, the word "column" can be replaced by "row" throughout. For example, viewing an n × n matrix as being composed of n rows, the determinant is an n-linear function.= Multiplicativity and matrix groups =Thus the determinant is a multiplicative map, i.e., for square matrices                     A              {\displaystyle A}   and                     B              {\displaystyle B}   of equal size, the determinant of a matrix product equals the product of their determinants:                    det        (        A        B        )        =        det        (        A        )        det        (        B        )              {\displaystyle \det(AB)=\det(A)\det(B)}  This key fact can be proven by observing that, for a fixed matrix                     B              {\displaystyle B}  , both sides of the equation are alternating and multilinear as a function depending on the columns of                     A              {\displaystyle A}  . Moreover, they both take the value                     det        B              {\displaystyle \det B}   when                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is the identity matrix. The above-mentioned unique characterization of alternating multilinear maps therefore shows this claim.A matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is invertible precisely if its determinant is nonzero. This follows from the multiplicativity of                     det              {\displaystyle \det }   and the formula for the inverse involving the adjugate matrix mentioned below. In this event, the determinant of the inverse matrix is given by                    det                  (                      A                          −              1                                )                =                              1                          det              (              A              )                                      =        [        det        (        A        )                  ]                      −            1                                {\displaystyle \det \left(A^{-1}\right)={\frac {1}{\det(A)}}=[\det(A)]^{-1}}  .In particular, products and inverses of matrices with non-zero determinant (respectively, determinant one) still have this property. Thus, the set of such matrices (of fixed size                     n              {\displaystyle n}  ) forms a group known as the general linear group                               GL                      n                                {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} _{n}}   (respectively, a subgroup called the special linear group                               SL                      n                          ⊂                  GL                      n                                {\displaystyle \operatorname {SL} _{n}\subset \operatorname {GL} _{n}}  . More generally, the word "special" indicates the subgroup of another matrix group of matrices of determinant one. Examples include the special orthogonal group (which if n is 2 or 3 consists of all rotation matrices), and the special unitary group.The Cauchy–Binet formula is a generalization of that product formula for rectangular matrices. This formula can also be recast as a multiplicative formula for compound matrices whose entries are the determinants of all quadratic submatrices of a given matrix.= Laplace expansion =Laplace expansion expresses the determinant of a matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}   in terms of determinants of smaller matrices, known as its minors. The minor                               M                      i            ,            j                                {\displaystyle M_{i,j}}   is defined to be the determinant of the                     (        n        −        1        )        ×        (        n        −        1        )              {\displaystyle (n-1)\times (n-1)}  -matrix that results from                     A              {\displaystyle A}   by removing the                     i              {\displaystyle i}  -th row and the                     j              {\displaystyle j}  -th column. The expression                     (        −        1                  )                      i            +            j                                    M                      i            ,            j                                {\displaystyle (-1)^{i+j}M_{i,j}}   is known as a cofactor. For every                     i              {\displaystyle i}  , one has the equality                    det        (        A        )        =                  ∑                      j            =            1                                n                          (        −        1                  )                      i            +            j                                    a                      i            j                                    M                      i            j                          ,              {\displaystyle \det(A)=\sum _{j=1}^{n}(-1)^{i+j}a_{ij}M_{ij},}  which is called the Laplace expansion along the ith row. For example, the Laplace expansion along the first row (                    i        =        1              {\displaystyle i=1}  ) gives the following formula:                                          |                                                            a                                                  b                                                  c                                                                              d                                                  e                                                  f                                                                              g                                                  h                                                  i                                                      |                          =        a                              |                                                            e                                                  f                                                                              h                                                  i                                                      |                          −        b                              |                                                            d                                                  f                                                                              g                                                  i                                                      |                          +        c                              |                                                            d                                                  e                                                                              g                                                  h                                                      |                                {\displaystyle {\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\d&e&f\\g&h&i\end{vmatrix}}=a{\begin{vmatrix}e&f\\h&i\end{vmatrix}}-b{\begin{vmatrix}d&f\\g&i\end{vmatrix}}+c{\begin{vmatrix}d&e\\g&h\end{vmatrix}}}  Unwinding the determinants of these                     2        ×        2              {\displaystyle 2\times 2}  -matrices gives back the Leibniz formula mentioned above. Similarly, the Laplace expansion along the                     j              {\displaystyle j}  -th column is the equality                    det        (        A        )        =                  ∑                      i            =            1                                n                          (        −        1                  )                      i            +            j                                    a                      i            j                                    M                      i            j                          .              {\displaystyle \det(A)=\sum _{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{i+j}a_{ij}M_{ij}.}  Laplace expansion can be used iteratively for computing determinants, but this approach is inefficient for large matrices. However, it is useful for computing the determinants of highly symmetric matrix such as the Vandermonde matrixThis determinant has been applied, for example, in the proof of Baker's theorem in the theory of transcendental numbers.

In Europe, solutions of linear systems of two equations were expressed by Cardano in 1545 by a determinant-like entity.Determinants proper originated from the work of Seki Takakazu in 1683 in Japan and parallelly of Leibniz in 1693. Cramer (1750) stated, without proof, Cramer's rule. Both Cramer and also Bezout (1779) were led to determinants by the question of plane curves passing through a given set of points.Vandermonde (1771) first recognized determinants as independent functions. Laplace (1772) gave the general method of expanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors: Vandermonde had already given a special case. Immediately following, Lagrange (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of elimination theory; he proved many special cases of general identities.Gauss (1801) made the next advance. Like Lagrange, he made much use of determinants in the theory of numbers. He introduced the word "determinant" (Laplace had used "resultant"), though not in the present signification, but rather as applied to the discriminant of a quantic. Gauss also arrived at the notion of reciprocal (inverse) determinants, and came very near the multiplication theorem.The next contributor of importance is Binet (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m columns and n rows, which for the special case of m = n reduces to the multiplication theorem. On the same day (November 30, 1812) that Binet presented his paper to the Academy, Cauchy also presented one on the subject. (See Cauchy–Binet formula.) In this he used the word "determinant" in its present sense, summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet's. With him begins the theory in its generality.(Jacobi 1841) used the functional determinant which Sylvester later called the Jacobian. In his memoirs in Crelle's Journal for 1841 he specially treats this subject, as well as the class of alternating functions which Sylvester has called alternants. About the time of Jacobi's last memoirs, Sylvester (1839) and Cayley began their work. Cayley 1841 introduced the modern notation for the determinant using vertical bars.The study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory. Axisymmetric determinants have been studied by Lebesgue, Hesse, and Sylvester; persymmetric determinants by Sylvester and Hankel; circulants by Catalan, Spottiswoode, Glaisher, and Scott; skew determinants and Pfaffians, in connection with the theory of orthogonal transformation, by Cayley; continuants by Sylvester; Wronskians (so called by Muir) by Christoffel and Frobenius; compound determinants by Sylvester, Reiss, and Picquet; Jacobians and Hessians by Sylvester; and symmetric gauche determinants by Trudi. Of the textbooks on the subject Spottiswoode's was the first. In America, Hanus (1886), Weld (1893), and Muir/Metzler (1933) published treatises. Applications = Cramer's rule =Determinants can be used to describe the solutions of a linear system of equations, written in matrix form as                     A        x        =        b              {\displaystyle Ax=b}  . This equation has a unique solution                     x              {\displaystyle x}   if and only if                     det        (        A        )              {\displaystyle \det(A)}   is nonzero. In this case, the solution is given by Cramer's rule:                              x                      i                          =                                            det              (                              A                                  i                                            )                                      det              (              A              )                                              i        =        1        ,        2        ,        3        ,        …        ,        n              {\displaystyle x_{i}={\frac {\det(A_{i})}{\det(A)}}\qquad i=1,2,3,\ldots ,n}  where                               A                      i                                {\displaystyle A_{i}}   is the matrix formed by replacing the                     i              {\displaystyle i}  -th column of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   by the column vector                     b              {\displaystyle b}  .

If it can be shown that the Wronskian is zero everywhere on an interval then, in the case of analytic functions, this implies the given functions are linearly dependent. See the Wronskian and linear independence. Another such use of the determinant is the resultant, which gives a criterion when two polynomials have a common root.= Orientation of a basis =The determinant can be thought of as assigning a number to every sequence of n vectors in Rn, by using the square matrix whose columns are the given vectors. For instance, an orthogonal matrix with entries in Rn represents an orthonormal basis in Euclidean space. The determinant of such a matrix determines whether the orientation of the basis is consistent with or opposite to the orientation of the standard basis. If the determinant is +1, the basis has the same orientation. If it is −1, the basis has the opposite orientation.More generally, if the determinant of A is positive, A represents an orientation-preserving linear transformation (if A is an orthogonal 2 × 2 or 3 × 3 matrix, this is a rotation), while if it is negative, A switches the orientation of the basis.= Volume and Jacobian determinant =As pointed out above, the absolute value of the determinant of real vectors is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by those vectors. As a consequence, if                     f        :                              R                                n                          →                              R                                n                                {\displaystyle f:\mathbf {R} ^{n}\to \mathbf {R} ^{n}}   is the linear map given by multiplication with a matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}  , and                     S        ⊂                              R                                n                                {\displaystyle S\subset \mathbf {R} ^{n}}   is any measurable subset, then the volume of                     f        (        S        )              {\displaystyle f(S)}   is given by                               |                det        (        A        )                  |                      {\displaystyle |\det(A)|}   times the volume of                     S              {\displaystyle S}  . More generally, if the linear map                     f        :                              R                                n                          →                              R                                m                                {\displaystyle f:\mathbf {R} ^{n}\to \mathbf {R} ^{m}}   is represented by the                     m        ×        n              {\displaystyle m\times n}  -matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}  , then the                     n              {\displaystyle n}  -dimensional volume of                     f        (        S        )              {\displaystyle f(S)}   is given by:                    volume        ⁡        (        f        (        S        )        )        =                              det                          (                                                A                                                            T                                                                      A                            )                                      volume        ⁡        (        S        )        .              {\displaystyle \operatorname {volume} (f(S))={\sqrt {\det \left(A^{\textsf {T}}A\right)}}\operatorname {volume} (S).}  By calculating the volume of the tetrahedron bounded by four points, they can be used to identify skew lines. The volume of any tetrahedron, given its vertices                     a        ,        b        ,        c        ,        d              {\displaystyle a,b,c,d}  ,                                           1            6                          ⋅                  |                det        (        a        −        b        ,        b        −        c        ,        c        −        d        )                  |                      {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{6}}\cdot |\det(a-b,b-c,c-d)|}  , or any other combination of pairs of vertices that form a spanning tree over the vertices.For a general differentiable function, much of the above carries over by considering the Jacobian matrix of f. For                    f        :                              R                                n                          →                              R                                n                          ,              {\displaystyle f:\mathbf {R} ^{n}\rightarrow \mathbf {R} ^{n},}  the Jacobian matrix is the n × n matrix whose entries are given by the partial derivatives                    D        (        f        )        =                              (                                                            ∂                                      f                                          i                                                                                        ∂                                      x                                          j                                                                                            )                                1            ≤            i            ,            j            ≤            n                          .              {\displaystyle D(f)=\left({\frac {\partial f_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}\right)_{1\leq i,j\leq n}.}  Its determinant, the Jacobian determinant, appears in the higher-dimensional version of integration by substitution: for suitable functions f and an open subset U of Rn (the domain of f), the integral over f(U) of some other function φ : Rn → Rm is given by                              ∫                      f            (            U            )                          ϕ        (                  v                )                d                  v                =                  ∫                      U                          ϕ        (        f        (                  u                )        )                  |                      det            (            D            ⁡            f            )            (                          u                        )                    |                        d                  u                .              {\displaystyle \int _{f(U)}\phi (\mathbf {v} )\,d\mathbf {v} =\int _{U}\phi (f(\mathbf {u} ))\left|\det(\operatorname {D} f)(\mathbf {u} )\right|\,d\mathbf {u} .}  The Jacobian also occurs in the inverse function theorem. Abstract algebraic aspects = Determinant of an endomorphism =The above identities concerning the determinant of products and inverses of matrices imply that similar matrices have the same determinant: two matrices A and B are similar, if there exists an invertible matrix X such that A = X−1BX. Indeed, repeatedly applying the above identities yields                    det        (        A        )        =        det        (        X                  )                      −            1                          det        (        B        )        det        (        X        )        =        det        (        B        )        det        (        X                  )                      −            1                          det        (        X        )        =        det        (        B        )        .              {\displaystyle \det(A)=\det(X)^{-1}\det(B)\det(X)=\det(B)\det(X)^{-1}\det(X)=\det(B).}  The determinant is therefore also called a similarity invariant. The determinant of a linear transformation                    T        :        V        →        V              {\displaystyle T:V\to V}  for some finite-dimensional vector space V is defined to be the determinant of the matrix describing it, with respect to an arbitrary choice of basis in V. By the similarity invariance, this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis for V and therefore only depends on the endomorphism T.= Square matrices over commutative rings =The above definition of the determinant using the Leibniz rule holds works more generally when the entries of the matrix are elements of a commutative ring                     R              {\displaystyle R}  , such as the integers                               Z                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {Z} }  , as opposed to the field of real or complex numbers. Moreover, the characterization of the determinant as the unique alternating multilinear map that satisfies                     det        (        I        )        =        1              {\displaystyle \det(I)=1}   still holds, as do all the properties that result from that characterization.A matrix                     A        ∈                  Mat                      n            ×            n                          ⁡        (        R        )              {\displaystyle A\in \operatorname {Mat} _{n\times n}(R)}   is invertible (in the sense that there is an inverse matrix whose entries are in                     R              {\displaystyle R}  ) if and only if its determinant is an invertible element in                     R              {\displaystyle R}  . For                     R        =                  Z                      {\displaystyle R=\mathbf {Z} }  , this means that the determinant is +1 or −1. Such a matrix is called unimodular.The determinant being multiplicative, it defines a group homomorphism                              GL                      n                          ⁡        (        R        )        →                  R                      ×                          ,              {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} _{n}(R)\rightarrow R^{\times },}  between the general linear group (the group of invertible                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}  -matrices with entries in                     R              {\displaystyle R}  ) and the multiplicative group of units in                     R              {\displaystyle R}  . Since it respects the multiplication in both groups, this map is a group homomorphism.Given a ring homomorphism                     f        :        R        →        S              {\displaystyle f:R\to S}  , there is a map                               GL                      n                          ⁡        (        f        )        :                  GL                      n                          ⁡        (        R        )        →                  GL                      n                          ⁡        (        S        )              {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} _{n}(f):\operatorname {GL} _{n}(R)\to \operatorname {GL} _{n}(S)}   given by replacing all entries in                     R              {\displaystyle R}   by their images under                     f              {\displaystyle f}  . The determinant respects these maps, i.e., the identity                    f        (        det        (        (                  a                      i            ,            j                          )        )        )        =        det        (        (        f        (                  a                      i            ,            j                          )        )        )              {\displaystyle f(\det((a_{i,j})))=\det((f(a_{i,j})))}  holds. In other words, the displayed commutative diagram commutes.For example, the determinant of the complex conjugate of a complex matrix (which is also the determinant of its conjugate transpose) is the complex conjugate of its determinant, and for integer matrices: the reduction modulo                     m              {\displaystyle m}   of the determinant of such a matrix is equal to the determinant of the matrix reduced modulo                     m              {\displaystyle m}   (the latter determinant being computed using modular arithmetic). In the language of category theory, the determinant is a natural transformation between the two functors                               GL                      n                                {\displaystyle \operatorname {GL} _{n}}   and                     (        −                  )                      ×                                {\displaystyle (-)^{\times }}  . Adding yet another layer of abstraction, this is captured by saying that the determinant is a morphism of algebraic groups, from the general linear group to the multiplicative group,                    det        :                  GL                      n                          →                              G                                m                          .              {\displaystyle \det :\operatorname {GL} _{n}\to \mathbb {G} _{m}.}  = Exterior algebra =The determinant of a linear transformation                     T        :        V        →        V              {\displaystyle T:V\to V}   of an                     n              {\displaystyle n}  -dimensional vector space                     V              {\displaystyle V}   or, more generally a free module of (finite) rank                     n              {\displaystyle n}   over a commutative ring                     R              {\displaystyle R}   can be formulated in a coordinate-free manner by considering the                     n              {\displaystyle n}  -th exterior power                               ⋀                      n                          V              {\displaystyle \bigwedge ^{n}V}   of                     V              {\displaystyle V}  . The map                     T              {\displaystyle T}   induces a linear map                                                                                          ⋀                                      n                                                  T                :                                  ⋀                                      n                                                  V                                                            →                                  ⋀                                      n                                                  V                                                                                      v                                      1                                                  ∧                                  v                                      2                                                  ∧                ⋯                ∧                                  v                                      n                                                                                              ↦                T                                  v                                      1                                                  ∧                T                                  v                                      2                                                  ∧                ⋯                ∧                T                                  v                                      n                                                  .                                                          {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\bigwedge ^{n}T:\bigwedge ^{n}V&\rightarrow \bigwedge ^{n}V\\v_{1}\wedge v_{2}\wedge \dots \wedge v_{n}&\mapsto Tv_{1}\wedge Tv_{2}\wedge \dots \wedge Tv_{n}.\end{aligned}}}  As                               ⋀                      n                          V              {\displaystyle \bigwedge ^{n}V}   is one-dimensional, the map                               ⋀                      n                          T              {\displaystyle \bigwedge ^{n}T}   is given by multiplying with some scalar, i.e., an element in                     R              {\displaystyle R}  . Some authors such as (Bourbaki 1998) use this fact to define the determinant to be the element in                     R              {\displaystyle R}   satisfying the following identity (for all                               v                      i                          ∈        V              {\displaystyle v_{i}\in V}  ):                              (                                    ⋀                              n                                      T                    )                          (                                    v                              1                                      ∧            ⋯            ∧                          v                              n                                              )                =        det        (        T        )        ⋅                  v                      1                          ∧        ⋯        ∧                  v                      n                          .              {\displaystyle \left(\bigwedge ^{n}T\right)\left(v_{1}\wedge \dots \wedge v_{n}\right)=\det(T)\cdot v_{1}\wedge \dots \wedge v_{n}.}  This definition agrees with the more concrete coordinate-dependent definition. This can be shown using the unicity of a multilinear alternating form on                     n              {\displaystyle n}  -tuples of vectors in                               R                      n                                {\displaystyle R^{n}}  .For this reason, the highest non-zero exterior power                               ⋀                      n                          V              {\displaystyle \bigwedge ^{n}V}   (as opposed to the determinant associated to an endomorphism) is sometimes also called the determinant of                     V              {\displaystyle V}   and similarly for more involved objects such as vector bundles or chain complexes of vector spaces. Minors of a matrix can also be cast in this setting, by considering lower alternating forms                               ⋀                      k                          V              {\displaystyle \bigwedge ^{k}V}   with                     k        <        n              {\displaystyle k<n}  . Generalizations and related notions Determinants as treated above admit several variants: the permanent of a matrix is defined as the determinant, except that the factors                     sgn        ⁡        (        σ        )              {\displaystyle \operatorname {sgn}(\sigma )}   occurring in Leibniz's rule are omitted. The immanant generalizes both by introducing a character of the symmetric group                               S                      n                                {\displaystyle S_{n}}   in Leibniz's rule.= Determinants for finite-dimensional algebras =For any associative algebra                     A              {\displaystyle A}   that is finite-dimensional as a vector space over a field                     F              {\displaystyle F}  , there is a determinant map                    det        :        A        →        F        .              {\displaystyle \det :A\to F.}  This definition proceeds by establishing the characteristic polynomial independently of the determinant, and defining the determinant as the lowest order term of this polynomial. This general definition recovers the determinant for the matrix algebra                     A        =                  Mat                      n            ×            n                          ⁡        (        F        )              {\displaystyle A=\operatorname {Mat} _{n\times n}(F)}  , but also includes several further cases including the determinant of a quaternion,                    det        (        a        +        i        b        +        j        c        +        k        d        )        =                  a                      2                          +                  b                      2                          +                  c                      2                          +                  d                      2                                {\displaystyle \det(a+ib+jc+kd)=a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}}  ,the norm                               N                      L                          /                        F                          :        L        →        F              {\displaystyle N_{L/F}:L\to F}   of a field extension, as well as the Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric matrix and the reduced norm of a central simple algebra, also arise as special cases of this construction.= Infinite matrices =For matrices with an infinite number of rows and columns, the above definitions of the determinant do not carry over directly. For example, in the Leibniz formula, an infinite sum (all of whose terms are infinite products) would have to be calculated. Functional analysis provides different extensions of the determinant for such infinite-dimensional situations, which however only work for particular kinds of operators.The Fredholm determinant defines the determinant for operators known as trace class operators by an appropriate generalization of the formula                    det        (        I        +        A        )        =        exp        ⁡        (        tr        ⁡        (        log        ⁡        (        I        +        A        )        )        )        .              {\displaystyle \det(I+A)=\exp(\operatorname {tr} (\log(I+A))).}  Another infinite-dimensional notion of determinant is the functional determinant.= Operators in von Neumann algebras =For operators in a finite factor, one may define a positive real-valued determinant called the Fuglede−Kadison determinant using the canonical trace. In fact, corresponding to every tracial state on a von Neumann algebra there is a notion of Fuglede−Kadison determinant.= Related notions for non-commutative rings =For matrices over non-commutative rings, multilinearity and alternating properties are incompatible for n ≥ 2, so there is no good definition of the determinant in this setting.For square matrices with entries in a non-commutative ring, there are various difficulties in defining determinants analogously to that for commutative rings. A meaning can be given to the Leibniz formula provided that the order for the product is specified, and similarly for other definitions of the determinant, but non-commutativity then leads to the loss of many fundamental properties of the determinant, such as the multiplicative property or that the determinant is unchanged under transposition of the matrix. Over non-commutative rings, there is no reasonable notion of a multilinear form (existence of a nonzero bilinear form with a regular element of R as value on some pair of arguments implies that R is commutative). Nevertheless, various notions of non-commutative determinant have been formulated that preserve some of the properties of determinants, notably quasideterminants and the Dieudonné determinant. For some classes of matrices with non-commutative elements, one can define the determinant and prove linear algebra theorems that are very similar to their commutative analogs. Examples include the q-determinant on quantum groups, the Capelli determinant on Capelli matrices, and the Berezinian on supermatrices (i.e., matrices whose entries are elements of                                           Z                                2                                {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{2}}  -graded rings). Manin matrices form the class closest to matrices with commutative elements. Calculation Determinants are mainly used as a theoretical tool. They are rarely calculated explicitly in numerical linear algebra, where for applications like checking invertibility and finding eigenvalues the determinant has largely been supplanted by other techniques. Computational geometry, however, does frequently use calculations related to determinants.While the determinant can be computed directly using the Leibniz rule this approach is extremely inefficient for large matrices, since that formula requires calculating                     n        !              {\displaystyle n!}   (                    n              {\displaystyle n}   factorial) products for an                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}  -matrix. Thus, the number of required operations grows very quickly: it is of order                     n        !              {\displaystyle n!}  . The Laplace expansion is similarly inefficient. Therefore, more involved techniques have been developed for calculating determinants.= Decomposition methods =Some methods compute                     det        (        A        )              {\displaystyle \det(A)}   by writing the matrix as a product of matrices whose determinants can be more easily computed. Such techniques are referred to as decomposition methods. Examples include the LU decomposition, the QR decomposition or the Cholesky decomposition (for positive definite matrices). These methods are of order                     O        ⁡        (                  n                      3                          )              {\displaystyle \operatorname {O} (n^{3})}  , which is a significant improvement over                     O        ⁡        (        n        !        )              {\displaystyle \operatorname {O} (n!)}  .For example, LU decomposition expresses                     A              {\displaystyle A}   as a product                    A        =        P        L        U        .              {\displaystyle A=PLU.}  of a permutation matrix                     P              {\displaystyle P}   (which has exactly a single                     1              {\displaystyle 1}   in each column, and otherwise zeros), a lower triangular matrix                     L              {\displaystyle L}   and an upper triangular matrix                     U              {\displaystyle U}  .The determinants of the two triangular matrices                     L              {\displaystyle L}   and                     U              {\displaystyle U}   can be quickly calculated, since they are the products of the respective diagonal entries.  The determinant of                     P              {\displaystyle P}   is just the sign                     ε              {\displaystyle \varepsilon }   of the corresponding permutation (which is                     +        1              {\displaystyle +1}   for an even number of permutations and is                     −        1              {\displaystyle -1}   for an odd number of permutations). Once such a LU decomposition is known for                     A              {\displaystyle A}  , its determinant is readily computed as                    det        (        A        )        =        ε        det        (        L        )        ⋅        det        (        U        )        .              {\displaystyle \det(A)=\varepsilon \det(L)\cdot \det(U).}  = Further methods =The order                     O        ⁡        (                  n                      3                          )              {\displaystyle \operatorname {O} (n^{3})}   reached by decomposition methods has been improved by different methods. If two matrices of order                     n              {\displaystyle n}   can be multiplied in time                     M        (        n        )              {\displaystyle M(n)}  , where                     M        (        n        )        ≥                  n                      a                                {\displaystyle M(n)\geq n^{a}}   for some                     a        >        2              {\displaystyle a>2}  , then there is an algorithm computing the determinant in time                     O        (        M        (        n        )        )              {\displaystyle O(M(n))}  . This means, for example, that an                     O        ⁡        (                  n                      2.376                          )              {\displaystyle \operatorname {O} (n^{2.376})}   algorithm exists based on the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm. This exponent has been further lowered, as of 2016, to 2.373.In addition to the complexity of the algorithm, further criteria can be used to compare algorithms.Especially for applications concerning matrices over rings, algorithms that compute the determinant without any divisions exist. (By contrast, Gauss elimination requires divisions.) One such algorithm, having complexity                     O        ⁡        (                  n                      4                          )              {\displaystyle \operatorname {O} (n^{4})}   is based on the following idea: one replaces permutations (as in the Leibniz rule) by so-called closed ordered walks, in which several items can be repeated. The resulting sum has more terms than in the Leibniz rule, but in the process several of these products can be reused, making it more efficient than naively computing with the Leibniz rule. Algorithms can also be assessed according to their bit complexity, i.e., how many bits of accuracy are needed to store intermediate values occurring in the computation. For example, the Gaussian elimination (or LU decomposition) method is of order                     O        ⁡        (                  n                      3                          )              {\displaystyle \operatorname {O} (n^{3})}  , but the bit length of intermediate values can become exponentially long. By comparison, the Bareiss Algorithm, is an exact-division method (so it does use division, but only in cases where these divisions can be performed without remainder) is of the same order, but the bit complexity is roughly the bit size of the original entries in the matrix times                     n              {\displaystyle n}  .If the determinant of A and the inverse of A have already been computed, the matrix determinant lemma allows rapid calculation of the determinant of A + uvT, where u and v are column vectors.Charles Dodgson (i.e. Lewis Carroll of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland fame) invented a method for computing determinants called Dodgson condensation.  Unfortunately this interesting method does not always work in its original form.
