The Super Junior Tag League is a professional wrestling  tag team tournament held by New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW).
Established in 2010, but  preceded by the G1 Climax Junior Heavyweight Tag League in 2001 (won by El Samurai and Jushin Thunder Liger), it is the junior heavyweight equivalent of the World Tag League for heavyweight tag teams. From 2010 to 2017, it was named the Super Junior Tag Tournament and followed a single-elimination format, before becoming the Super Junior Tag League in 2018, switching to a round-robin format. Since the tournament's inception, there were two years where the tournament did not take place—in 2011 and 2020 (due to major changes to NJPW's schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic).
