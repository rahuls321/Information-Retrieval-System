Stay safe[edit]Kudremukh is a ghost city where numerous buildings and facilities were abandoned after the mining was abandoned in 2005 as per the Supreme Court directives.  Bridges and buildings can suddenly collapse, look for rusted metal and don't forget to take your TT injection. Do not venture to Kudremukha peak unless a local guide accompanies you for trek, there chances of being lost in the wilderness. Follow the rules imposed by Karnataka forest department to keep away from littering of plastics and other non bio degradable wastes also to avoid  fire. Carry a torch (flash light) with dry battery cells, water, whistle, some edibles  for the trek. Rain coat should be carried during rainy season because it rains heavily in the region.
