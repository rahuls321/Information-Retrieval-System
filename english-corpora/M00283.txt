In linear algebra, a square matrix with complex entries is said to be skew-Hermitian or anti-Hermitian if its conjugate transpose is the negative of the original matrix. That is, the matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is skew-Hermitian if it satisfies the relationwhere                               A                                    H                                            {\displaystyle A^{\textsf {H}}}   denotes the conjugate transpose of the matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}  .  In component form, this means thatfor all indices                     i              {\displaystyle i}   and                     j              {\displaystyle j}  , where                               a                      i            j                                {\displaystyle a_{ij}}   is the element in the                     j              {\displaystyle j}  -th row and                     i              {\displaystyle i}  -th column of                     A              {\displaystyle A}  , and the overline denotes complex conjugation.Skew-Hermitian matrices can be understood as the complex versions of real skew-symmetric matrices, or as the matrix analogue of the purely imaginary numbers.  The set of all skew-Hermitian                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}   matrices forms the                     u        (        n        )              {\displaystyle u(n)}   Lie algebra, which corresponds to the Lie group U(n). The concept can be generalized to include linear transformations of any complex vector space with a sesquilinear norm.Note that the adjoint of an operator depends on the scalar product considered on the                     n              {\displaystyle n}   dimensional complex or real space                               K                      n                                {\displaystyle K^{n}}  . If                     (        ⋅        ∣        ⋅        )              {\displaystyle (\cdot \mid \cdot )}   denotes the scalar product on                               K                      n                                {\displaystyle K^{n}}  , then saying                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is skew-adjoint means that for all                               u                ,                  v                ∈                  K                      n                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} ,\mathbf {v} \in K^{n}}   one has                     (        A                  u                ∣                  v                )        =        −        (                  u                ∣        A                  v                )              {\displaystyle (A\mathbf {u} \mid \mathbf {v} )=-(\mathbf {u} \mid A\mathbf {v} )}  .Imaginary numbers can be thought of as skew-adjoint (since they are like                     1        ×        1              {\displaystyle 1\times 1}   matrices), whereas real numbers correspond to self-adjoint operators. Example For example, the following matrix is skew-Hermitianbecause Properties The eigenvalues of a skew-Hermitian matrix are all purely imaginary (and possibly zero). Furthermore, skew-Hermitian matrices are normal. Hence they are diagonalizable and their eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues must be orthogonal.All entries on the main diagonal of a skew-Hermitian matrix have to be pure imaginary; i.e., on the imaginary axis (the number zero is also considered purely imaginary).If                     A              {\displaystyle A}   and                     B              {\displaystyle B}   are skew-Hermitian, then                     a        A        +        b        B              {\displaystyle aA+bB}   is skew-Hermitian for all real scalars                     a              {\displaystyle a}   and                     b              {\displaystyle b}  .                    A              {\displaystyle A}   is skew-Hermitian if and only if                     i        A              {\displaystyle iA}   (or equivalently,                     −        i        A              {\displaystyle -iA}  ) is Hermitian.

A              {\displaystyle A}   is skew-Hermitian if and only if                                           x                                              H                                      A                  y                =        −                              y                                              H                                      A                  x                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} ^{\mathsf {H}}A\mathbf {y} =-\mathbf {y} ^{\mathsf {H}}A\mathbf {x} }   for all vectors                               x                ,                  y                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} }  .If                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is skew-Hermitian, then the matrix exponential                               e                      A                                {\displaystyle e^{A}}   is unitary.The space of skew-Hermitian matrices forms the Lie algebra                     u        (        n        )              {\displaystyle u(n)}   of the Lie group                     U        (        n        )              {\displaystyle U(n)}  . Decomposition into Hermitian and skew-Hermitian The sum of a square matrix and its conjugate transpose                               (                      A            +                          A                                                H                                                              )                      {\displaystyle \left(A+A^{\mathsf {H}}\right)}   is Hermitian.The difference of a square matrix and its conjugate transpose                               (                      A            −                          A                                                H                                                              )                      {\displaystyle \left(A-A^{\mathsf {H}}\right)}   is skew-Hermitian.
