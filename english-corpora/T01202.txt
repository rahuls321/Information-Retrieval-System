Kuchaman Fort[edit]
  Kuchaman City and Fort, 2006
Perched atop a 1,000-foot-high (300 m) cliff, the Kuchaman Fort is the most important attraction in Kuchaman. It was built by a Gurjara-Pratihara king during 730-760.[2]Currently a heritage hotel, the fort displays a rich collection of original inlay work in semi-precious stones, glass, and gold paint. The Sheesh Mahal (glass palace) is a sight for marvel. A colorful bazaar, located below the fort, is a great place to shop for handicrafts and fabrics.

Meera Mahal[edit]
The Meera Mahal is an exquisite palace which plays host to the miniature paintings illustrating the life story of Rathore poet-saint Meerabai, the passionate devotee of Lord Krishna. Meera Mahal, which contains a solid display of paintings on the life of Mirabai( who was from the Rathore dynasty and she was a poet Saint). She later married a strong warrior namely Rana Sangha.[1] The passion and dedication with which Meera (a married Rajput woman) worshiped Lord Krishna has been a part of the folklore for ages and is still considered to be one of the finest efforts by any devotee to evince the allegiance to the Lord. Ranjit Singh constructed the Mahal (Palace) and its temple, which contains lok devta and gurus.

Jal Mahal[edit]
Jal Mahal (Water Palace) is a unique concept visualized and implemented with an aim to provide the queens and princesses with a hidden swimming pool. The fort has two swimming pools. Jal Mahal, an underground pool, is royal in every aspect with its supercilious cloisters and arcades. The fort is now a heritage hotel and provides an opportunity to its customers to swim in these pools and envisage the imperial beauties that once owned and used it. Apparently the pool is also capable of controlling the water temperature.

Sabha Prakash[edit]
The Sabha Prakash (Illumination Meeting) used to be the formal chambers for meetings and for holding court to interact with citizens. Many critical decisions for welfare and dispute settlement were delivered from the main hall. The hall itself is decorated exquisitely and is adorned with polished walls strewn with semi-precious pebbles and shingles that are intricately inlaid. The decoration of the Sabha Prakash was deliberately done, keeping in mind the exhaustive exposure it would have to the public eye. The decoration shifts towards the Shekhavati style. However, most of the decoration is unique to the Kuchaman Fort.

Lok Dev Temple[edit]
Built by Ranjit Singh, this temple showcases paintings of Lok Devtas (folk-deity) such as Sant Gogaji, Baba Ram Dev, Sant Ravi Das, and Sant Kabir.

Chini Pole (चीणी पोळ)[edit]
Complete with intricately painted interiors, this pole was constructed by a Chinese traveler who wanted to narrate his travel experiences in a unique way.

Ganesh Dungri[edit]
Ganesh Dungri, is a Hindu temple located in Kuchaman. The grand temple is located on an elevated at Dungari hill in Kuchaman. The temple is sometimes also referred to as the Ganesh Temple. This temple is believed to have been built during the rule of the Raja Hari Singh.

Shakambhri Hill[edit]
Shakti Peeth Shakumbhri, meaning the abode of Shakti Goddess Shakambhari or Shakumbhri, is situated outside the urban area, at a distance of 3 km (1.9 mi) to the South of Kuchaman. Perched in the midst of the Aravali mountain range, this temple is believed to have been built during the rule of the Raja Pratap Singh. Twice a year, in the Ashwin and Chaitra months of the Hindu calendar (during the days of Navratra), the famous Shakumbhri Mela is organised. About 100 meter southeast of Shakumbari lies the Bhura Dev (BHAIRAV) temple which is considered to be the guard of Shakumbari Devi.
