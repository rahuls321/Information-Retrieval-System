Etymology[edit]
Palampur is a combination of three words Pani, Alam and Pur. Pani is water, Alam is environment or 'abode of', and Pur refers to a settlement. Hence, Palampur is a settlement where there is plenty of rainfall. It is a settlement whose socio-cultural and environmental factors are determined by rainfall. Similarly, Bandla, a nearby settlement, appears to have derived its name consisting of two words Boond (water) and Ala (coming), implying a village with persistent rainfall. Another nearby village Banuri, consists of two words Ban (dam) and Ruri (washed away), implying a place where the dam had been washed away. All the three settlements try to highlight that there is heavy downpour in and around Palampur.[3]

History[edit]
Palampur is located in the Kangra Valley. It is a famous hill station and was once a part of the Jalandhar kingdom. The town came into being when Dr. Jameson, the superintendent of Botanical Gardens, introduced the tea bush from Almora in 1849. The bush thrived in the climatic conditions of Palampur and became the focal point of the European tea estate owners with an exception of the famous Wah Tea Estate which was owned by Nawab Muhammad Hayat Khan and his descendants, until 1947.[8] Since then, the Kangra tea of Palampur has become internationally renowned.
The first prime minister of independent India, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, visited Palampur in 1941. There is a Nehru Chowk in Palampur to commemorate this visit.

Pre-independence[edit]
The growth of tea estates from the mid-19th century prompted the administration to build infrastructure in Palampur, such as schools, colleges, and hospital. It also became the center of labourers engaged in tea leaves plucking, packing, and transportation.
The earthquake of 1905 left a trail of destruction. There was a lot of reconstruction done. In 1927, the railway line for the hydro-electric project at Joginder Nagar was laid.  An increase in employment options led to the growth of investment in the area.

Post independence[edit]
In 1947, Sobha Singh, a well known contemporary painter moved from Punjab to Andretta and developed his art gallery. He painted art pieces related to North Indian culture and shot into prominence as an artist. After 1947, regional inner-connectivity began to evolve.
A military station was established at Holta, a strategic location of the town. CSK Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University was established in 1978, followed by the establishment of C.S.I.R - Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology in 1983. Many infrastructure and sub-division departments were created for electricity board, housing board, public health services and public works department.
