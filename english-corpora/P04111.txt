This Story ends with the Uttară. It is held in reverence by Brahmå composed by Vālmīki and passes as the foremost of all under the name of the Ramayana. There upon as before, Visnu, who comprise the three worlds and all objects, mobile and immobile, again established himself as before in the land of immortals. There upon the celestials the Gandharvas, the great Rșis used to hear happily every day in heaven this poem of Rāmāyaṇa. At the Śrāddha cereinony the wise should chant this Rāmāyaṇa sacred like the Vedas, removing sins and increasing life and prosperity. Reading even a single verse of this poem, one who has no son, obtain him; one having not riches, gets by them, and people are freed from all sins. By reading even one slotter people are freed from all sins which they commit everyday. Clothes, cows, and gold should be conferred upon him who chants this poem, for he being pleased all the deities remain satisfied. Whoever reads this story of Rāmāyana, conferring a long life is honoured in this world along with his sons and grand-sons and as well as in the land of the dead. Whoever shall read this Rāmāyaṇa either in the morning, noon or evening, shall never wearied. The picturesque city of Ayodhyā remained devoid of men for many long years but was again peopled under the regime of the King Rsabha. Pracetā's son Vālmīki composed this poem, conferring long life, together with the future story of the deity and the Uttara Kāņdam. Even Brahmă admitted this.
