Patan is a town in the Indian state of Rajasthan. In the 12th century, it became the centre of a minor state called Tanwarawati or Torawati, ruled by Tomar dynasty.[1] Anangpall II, who established the city of Patan and ruled present day Delhi, who is considered to be a direct descendant of Raja Parikshit, son of Abhimanyu and grandson of Arjuna the Pandavas of mahabharata..[2] [3]  “Anangpal II was instrumental in populating Indraprastha and giving it its present name, Delhi. The region was in ruins when he ascended the throne in the 11th century, it was he who built Lal Kot fort and Anangtal Baoli. The Tomar rule over the region is attested by multiple inscriptions and coins, and their ancestry can be traced to the Pandavas (of the Mahabharata)" said BR Mani, former joint director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).[4]
