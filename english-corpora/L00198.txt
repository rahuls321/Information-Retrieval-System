In Ealing in 1963, housewife Alison Wilson is stunned when Alec, her husband of 22 years, dies of a sudden heart attack. As she grieves with their two sons, Gordon and Nigel, she is even more stunned when another woman arrives at her door claiming to be Mrs Gladys Wilson, Alec's widow. Alison, who met Alec while working at Secret Intelligence Service headquarters during the war, realises her husband lied about being divorced. The Mrs Wilsons agree to cooperate with the burial to avoid a public scandal and Gordon and Nigel discovering the truth. Alison's investigation continues when she discovers a third wife through Karim, Alec's handler in India.

Alison finds Dorothy, whom Alec married while stationed in India, before the war. Dorothy, who discovered Alec's affair with Alison, left London during the war and told their son, Michael, that Alec was killed during one of the battles of el Alamein. Alison also realises that Alec's lies were not merely about his wives; Blakefield House, a large estate used as a hospital during the war, was not the ancestral family home they would live in one day, as he had told Alison and their sons. Alison discovers that before the war, Alec's handler introduced him to Dorothy, an actress, as part of his cover in Lahore. Dorothy believed Gladys was Alec's sister and married him in a sham ceremony when she became pregnant. Karim tells Alison that Alec saved hundreds of lives through his work as a spy, and she must let it go – but she refuses.

At the end of the war, Alec is arrested for theft, which he claims is a cover to infiltrate fascists in prison. In 1963, Gordon reveals that he knows Blakefield is not theirs and that he once saw his father working in a hospital as a porter. Alison is determined to prove to her sons that their father indeed worked in the Foreign Office. Alec's boss at MI6 tells her that Alec was a pathological liar who was sacked in 1942 for fabricating intelligence but Karim insists he was set up by a double agent who wanted Alec's job, to feed intelligence to Moscow. Just when Alison's faith in Alec seems restored, a young boy and his mother arrive at the Wilson home looking for his father – Alec. The boy believes Alec is a doctor and his mother, a nurse, announces herself as Mrs Wilson. In 1967, Alison finds peace by becoming a nun and is finally able to tell the truth to her sons. The series ends by showing all of Alec Wilson's living descendants, who first met their extended families in 2007 and by stating that in 2018, the Foreign Office still refused to release its files on Alec Wilson, declaring them to be too sensitive.
