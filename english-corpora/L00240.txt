Elif Shafak[1] (Turkish: Elif Şafak, pronounced [eˈlif ʃaˈfak]; born 25 October 1971) is a Turkish-British[2] novelist, essayist, public speaker, political scientist[3] and activist.
Shafak has published 19 books 12 of which are novels[2] including her latest The Island of Missing Trees, shortlisted for the Costa Novel Award.[4] She is a bestselling author in many countries around the world and her work has been translated into 55 languages.[5] 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.[6] and RSL Ondaatje Prize;[7] and was Blackwell’s Book of the Year.[8] The Forty Rules of Love was chosen by BBC among the 100 Novels that Shaped Our World.[9] 
The Architect's Apprentice was chosen for the Duchess of Cornwall’s inaugural book club, The Reading Room.[10] Shafak holds a PhD in political science and she has taught at various universities in Turkey, the USA and the UK, including St Anne's College,[11] Oxford University, where she is an honorary fellow.[12] She also holds a Doctorate of Humane Letters from Bard College.[13]
Shafak is a Fellow and a Vice President of the Royal Society of Literature [14] and has been chosen among BBC's 100 most inspiring and influential women.[15] She was a member of Weforum Global Agenda Council on Creative Economy[16] and a founding member of ECFR (European Council on Foreign Relations).[17][18] An advocate for women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights and freedom of expression, Shafak is an inspiring public speaker and TEDGlobal speaker three times.[19] Shafak contributes to major publications around the world and she was awarded the medal of Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.[20] In 2017 she was chosen by Politico as one of the twelve people “who will give you a much-needed lift of the heart”.[21] She has judged numerous literary prizes, including PEN Nabokov prize[22] and she has chaired the Wellcome Prize.[23] Recently, Shafak was awarded the Halldór Laxness International Literature Prize for her contribution to 'the renewal of the art of storytelling’.[24]
Her works have prominently featured the city of Istanbul, and dealt with themes of Eastern and Western culture, roles of women in society, and human rights issues. Certain politically challenging topics addressed in her novels, such as child abuse and the Armenian genocide, have led to legal action from authorities in Turkey[25][26] that prompted her to emigrate to the United Kingdom.

Early life and education[edit]
Shafak was born in Strasbourg to philosopher Nuri Bilgin and Şafak Atayman, who later became a diplomat. After her parents separated, Shafak returned to Ankara, Turkey, where she was raised by her mother and maternal grandmother.[27] She says that growing up in a dysfunctional family was difficult, but that growing up in a non-patriarchal environment had a beneficial impact on her. Having grown up without her father, she met her half-brothers for the first time when she was in her mid-twenties.[28]
Shafak added her mother's first name— Turkish for "dawn" —to her own when constructing her pen name at the age of eighteen. Shafak spent her teenage years in Madrid, Jordan and Germany.[28]
Shafak studied an undergraduate degree in international relations at Middle East Technical University, and later took women's studies.[29] She holds a Ph.D. in political science.[30][31]   She has taught at universities in Turkey. Later emigrating to the United States, she was a fellow at Mount Holyoke College, a visiting professor at the University of Michigan, and was a tenured professor at the University of Arizona in Near Eastern studies.[28][32]
In the U.K., she held the Weidenfeld Visiting Professorship in Comparative European Literature at St Anne's College, the University of Oxford for the 2017–2018 academic year,[33] where she is an honorary fellow.[34]

Career[edit]
Shafak has published nineteen books, both fiction and nonfiction.[35]

Fiction[edit]
Shafak's first novel, Pinhan (The Hidden), was awarded the Rumi Prize in 1998, a Turkish literary prize.[36]
Shafak's 1999 novel Mahrem (The Gaze) was awarded "Best Novel" by the Turkish Authors' Association in 2000.[37]
Her next novel, Bit Palas (The Flea Palace, 2002), was shortlisted for Independent Best Foreign Fiction in 2005.[38][39]
Shafak released her first novel in English, The Saint of Incipient Insanities, in 2004.[28]
Her second novel in English, The Bastard of Istanbul, was long-listed for the Orange Prize.[40] It addresses the Armenian genocide, which is denied by the Turkish government. Shafak was prosecuted in July 2006 on charges of "insulting Turkishness" (Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code) for discussing the genocide in the novel. Had she been convicted, she would have faced a maximum jail term of three years. The Guardian commented that The Bastard of Istanbul may be the first Turkish novel to address the genocide.[41] She was acquitted of these charges in September 2006 at the prosecutor's request.[42]
Shafak's novel The Forty Rules of Love (Aşk in Turkish) became a bestseller in Turkey upon its release;[43] it sold more than 200,000 copies by 2009, surpassing a previous record of 120,000 copies set by Orhan Pamuk's The New Life.[44] In France, it was awarded a Prix ALEF* – Mention Spéciale Littérature Etrangére.[45] It was also nominated for the 2012 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.[46] In 2019, it was listed by the BBC as one of the 100 "most inspiring" novels[47] and one of the "100 novels that shaped our world".[9]
Her 2012 novel Honour, which focuses on an honour killing,[48] was nominated for the 2012 Man Asian Literary Prize and 2013 Women's Prize for Fiction,[49][50][51] followed by The Architect's Apprentice, about Mimar Sinan, in 2014.[28]
Her novel Three Daughters of Eve (2017), set in Istanbul and Oxford from the 1980s to the present day[52] was chosen by London Mayor Sadiq Khan as his favourite book of the year.[53] American writer Siri Hustvedt also praised the book.[54]
Following Margaret Atwood, David Mitchell and Sjon, Shafak was selected as the 2017 writer for the Future Library project. Her work The Last Taboo is the third part of a collection of 100 literary works that will not be published until 2114.[55]
Shafak's 2019 novel 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World, revolving around the life of an Istanbul sex worker, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.[6] In 2019, Shafak was investigated by Turkish prosecutors for addressing child abuse and sexual violence in her fiction writing.[26]
Shafak released her twelfth novel The Island of Missing Trees in 2021.[56]

Non-fiction[edit]
Shafak's non-fiction essays in Turkish have been collected in four books: Med-Cezir (2005),[57] Firarperest (2010),[58] Şemspare (2012)[59] and Sanma ki Yalnızsın (2017).[60]
In 2020, Shafak published How to Stay Sane in an Age of Division.[3]

In the media[edit]
Shafak has written for Time,[61] The Guardian,[62] La Repubblica,[63] The New Yorker,[64] The New York Times,[65] Der Spiegel[66] and New Statesman.[67]
Shafak has been a panellist or commentator on BBC World,[68] Euronews[69] and Al Jazeera English.[70]
In July 2017, Elif Shafak was chosen as a "castaway" on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.[71]
Shafak has been a TEDGlobal speaker three times.[19]

Themes[edit]
Istanbul[edit]
The city of Istanbul has been prominent in Shafak's writing. She depicts the city as a melting pot of different cultures and various contradictions.[72] Shafak has remarked: "Istanbul makes one comprehend, perhaps not intellectually but intuitively, that East and West are ultimately imaginary concepts, and can thereby be de-imagined and re-imagined."[61] In the same essay written for Time magazine Shafak says: "East and West is no water and oil. They do mix. And in a city like Istanbul they mix intensely, incessantly, amazingly."[61] The New York Times Book Review said of Shafak, "she has a particular genius for depicting backstreet Istanbul, where the myriad cultures of the Ottoman Empire are still in tangled evidence on every family tree."[25]
In a piece she wrote for the BBC, Shafak said, "Istanbul is like a huge, colourful Matrushka – you open it and find another doll inside. You open that, only to see a new doll nesting. It is a hall of mirrors where nothing is quite what it seems. One should be cautious when using categories to talk about Istanbul. If there is one thing the city doesn't like, it is clichés."[73]

Eastern and Western cultures[edit]
Shafak blends Eastern and Western ways of storytelling, and draws on oral and written culture. In The Washington Post, Ron Charles says, "Shafak speaks in a multivalent voice that captures the roiling tides of diverse cultures."[74] Mysticism and specifically Sufism has also been a theme in her work, particularly in The Forty Rules of Love.[75][76][43]

Feminism[edit]
A feminist and advocate for gender equality, Shafak's writing has addressed numerous feminist issues and the role of women in society.[75][72][52] Examples include motherhood[75] and violence against women.[72] In an interview with William Skidelsky for The Guardian, she said: "In Turkey, men write and women read. I want to see this change."[77]

Human rights[edit]
Shafak's novels have explored human rights issues, particularly those in Turkey. She has said "What literature tries to do is to re-humanize people who have been dehumanized ... People whose voices we never hear. That's a big part of my work".[78] Specific topics have included persecution of Yazidis, the Armenian genocide[72] and the treatment of various minorities in Turkey.[78]

Views[edit]
Freedom of speech[edit]
Shafak is an advocate for freedom of expression.[79] While taking part in the Free Speech Debate, she commented, "I am more interested in showing the things we have in common as fellow human beings, sharing the same planet and ultimately, the same sorrows and joys rather than adding yet another brick in the imaginary walls erected between cultures/religions/ethnicities."[80]

Political views[edit]
Shafak has been critical of the presidency of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, describing his tenure as leading to increased authoritarianism in Turkey.[81] She signed an open letter in protest against Turkey's Twitter ban in 2014, commenting: "the very core of democracy ... is lacking in today's Turkey".[82]
Shafak has spoken and written about various global political trends. In the 2010s, she drew parallels between Turkish political history and political developments in Europe and the United States.[76] Writing in The New Yorker in 2016, she said "Wave after wave of nationalism, isolationism, and tribalism have hit the shores of countries across Europe, and they have reached the United States. Jingoism and xenophobia are on the rise. It is an Age of Angst—and it is a short step from angst to anger and from anger to aggression."[64]
Shafak signed an open letter in protest against Russian persecution of homosexuals and blasphemy laws before Sochi 2014.[83]

Personal life[edit]
Shafak has lived  in Istanbul, and in the United States—in Boston, Michigan, and Arizona—before moving to the UK.[84] Shafak has lived in London since 2013,[28][85] but speaks of "carrying Istanbul in her soul".[86] As of 2019, Shafak had been in self-imposed exile from Turkey due to fear of prosecution.[76][87]
Shafak is married to the Turkish journalist Eyüp Can Sağlık, a former editor of the newspaper Radikal, with whom she has a daughter and a son.[85][88] In 2017, Shafak came out as bisexual.[89]
Following the birth of her daughter in 2006, Shafak suffered from postpartum depression, a period she addressed in her memoir Black Milk.[90]
