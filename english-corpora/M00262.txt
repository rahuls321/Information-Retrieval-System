In linear algebra, a coordinate vector is a representation of a vector as an ordered list of numbers that describes the vector in terms of a particular ordered basis. Coordinates are always specified relative to an ordered basis. Bases and their associated coordinate representations let one realize vector spaces and linear transformations concretely as column vectors, row vectors, and matrices; hence, they are useful in calculations.The idea of a coordinate vector can also be used for infinite-dimensional vector spaces, as addressed below. Definition Let V be a vector space of dimension n over a field F and let                     B        =        {                  b                      1                          ,                  b                      2                          ,        …        ,                  b                      n                          }              {\displaystyle B=\{b_{1},b_{2},\ldots ,b_{n}\}}  be an ordered basis for V.Then for every                     v        ∈        V              {\displaystyle v\in V}   there is a unique linear combination of the basis vectors that equals v:                    v        =                  α                      1                                    b                      1                          +                  α                      2                                    b                      2                          +        ⋯        +                  α                      n                                    b                      n                          .              {\displaystyle v=\alpha _{1}b_{1}+\alpha _{2}b_{2}+\cdots +\alpha _{n}b_{n}.}  The coordinate vector of v relative to B is the sequence of coordinates                    [        v                  ]                      B                          =        (                  α                      1                          ,                  α                      2                          ,        …        ,                  α                      n                          )        .              {\displaystyle [v]_{B}=(\alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{n}).}  This is also called the representation of v with respect of B, or the B representation of v. The α-s are called the coordinates of v. The order of the basis becomes important here, since it determines the order in which the coefficients are listed in the coordinate vector.Coordinate vectors of finite-dimensional vector spaces can be represented by matrices as column or row vectors. In the above notation, one can write                    [        v                  ]                      B                          =                              [                                                                                α                                          1                                                                                                                    ⋮                                                                                                  α                                          n                                                                                            ]                                {\displaystyle [v]_{B}={\begin{bmatrix}\alpha _{1}\\\vdots \\\alpha _{n}\end{bmatrix}}}  and                    [        v                  ]                      B                                T                          =                              [                                                                                α                                          1                                                                                                            α                                          2                                                                                        ⋯                                                                      α                                          n                                                                                            ]                                {\displaystyle [v]_{B}^{T}={\begin{bmatrix}\alpha _{1}&\alpha _{2}&\cdots &\alpha _{n}\end{bmatrix}}}  where                     [        v                  ]                      B                                T                                {\displaystyle [v]_{B}^{T}}   is the transpose of the matrice                     [        v                  ]                      B                                {\displaystyle [v]_{B}}  . The standard representation We can mechanize the above transformation by defining a function                               ϕ                      B                                {\displaystyle \phi _{B}}  , called the standard representation of V with respect to B, that takes every vector to its coordinate representation:                               ϕ                      B                          (        v        )        =        [        v                  ]                      B                                {\displaystyle \phi _{B}(v)=[v]_{B}}  . Then                               ϕ                      B                                {\displaystyle \phi _{B}}   is a linear transformation from V to Fn. In fact, it is an isomorphism, and its inverse                               ϕ                      B                                −            1                          :                  F                      n                          →        V              {\displaystyle \phi _{B}^{-1}:F^{n}\to V}   is simply                              ϕ                      B                                −            1                          (                  α                      1                          ,        …        ,                  α                      n                          )        =                  α                      1                                    b                      1                          +        ⋯        +                  α                      n                                    b                      n                          .              {\displaystyle \phi _{B}^{-1}(\alpha _{1},\ldots ,\alpha _{n})=\alpha _{1}b_{1}+\cdots +\alpha _{n}b_{n}.}  Alternatively, we could have defined                               ϕ                      B                                −            1                                {\displaystyle \phi _{B}^{-1}}   to be the above function from the beginning, realized that                               ϕ                      B                                −            1                                {\displaystyle \phi _{B}^{-1}}   is an isomorphism, and defined                               ϕ                      B                                {\displaystyle \phi _{B}}   to be its inverse.

If the dimension is κ, then there is some basis of κ elements for V. After an order is chosen, the basis can be considered an ordered basis. The elements of V are finite linear combinations of elements in the basis, which give rise to unique coordinate representations exactly as described before. The only change is that the indexing set for the coordinates is not finite. Since a given vector v is a finite linear combination of basis elements, the only nonzero entries of the coordinate vector for v will be the nonzero coefficients of the linear combination representing v. Thus the coordinate vector for v is zero except in finitely many entries.The linear transformations between (possibly) infinite-dimensional vector spaces can be modeled, analogously to the finite-dimensional case, with infinite matrices. The special case of the transformations from V into V is described in the full linear ring article. See also Change of basis References
