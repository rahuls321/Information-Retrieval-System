"Vaisampayana said, 'Hearing these words of the Brahmana, the sons of
Kunti seemed to be, as it were, pierced with darts. Indeed, all those
mighty heroes lost their peace of mind. Then the truthful Kunti,
beholding all her sons listless and inattentive, addressed Yudhishthira
and said, 'We have now lived many nights in the abode of this Brahmana.
We have passed our time pleasantly in this town, living on the alms
obtained from many honest and illustrious persons. O oppressor of foes,
as we have now seen often and often all the agreeable woods and gardens
that are in this part of the country, seeing them again would no longer
give any pleasure. O heroic scion of Kuru's race, alms also are not now
obtainable here as easily as before. If thou wishest it would be well for
us now to go to Panchala; we have not seen that country, it will, no
doubt, O hero, prove delightful to us. O crusher of foes, it hath been
heard by us that alms are obtainable in the country of the Panchala, and
that Yajnasena, the king thereof, is devoted to Brahmanas. I am of
opinion that it is not good to live long in one place. Therefore, O son,
if thou likest, it is good for us to go there.'
"Hearing these words, Yudhishthira said, 'It is our duty to obey thy
command, which, besides, must be for our good, I do not, however, know
whether my younger brothers are willing to go.'"
