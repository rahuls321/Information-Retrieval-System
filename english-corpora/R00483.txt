== Plot ==
As described in a film magazine, Lady Marion Grimwood (Dalton) finds little congeniality in her union with Sir Robert Grimwood (Cook) and welcomes the innocent attentions of John Heritage (Mortimer) when he shows an interest in her. The sudden death of her husband by drowning is apparently explained when she receives a note claiming that Sir Robert knew of her attachment to John before his death. While she ponders over this, unwilling to believe in its entirety, she is attacked by Sir Waiverly (Neill), whose attempt to kill her is blocked. It is then discovered that a Chinese man, Ling Foo, possesses a poison that paralyzes will power. This, it is discovered, was the cause of Sir Robert's death. With this last obstacle removed, Lady Marion and John look forward to a life of happiness.
