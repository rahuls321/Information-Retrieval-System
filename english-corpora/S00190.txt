The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS; Chinese: 中国科学院) is the national academy for the natural sciences of the People's Republic of China. It has historical origins in the Academia Sinica during the Republican era and was formerly also known by that name. Collectively known as the "Two Academies (两院)" along with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, it functions as the national scientific think tank and academic governing body, providing advisory and appraisal services on issues stemming from the national economy, social development, and science and technology progress.  It is headquartered in Xicheng District, Beijing,[3] with branch institutes all over mainland China. It has also created hundreds of commercial enterprises, Lenovo being one of the most famous.
It is the world's largest research organization, comprising around 60,000 researchers working in 114 institutes,[4][5] and has been consistently ranked among the top research organizations around the world.[6][7][4] It also holds the University of Science and Technology of China and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.[8]
The Chinese Academy of Sciences has been ranked the No. 1 research institute in the world by Nature Index since the list's inception in 2016 by Nature Portfolio.[9] It is the most productive institution publishing articles of sustainable development indexed in Web of Science from 1981 to 2018 among all universities and research institutions in the world.[10]

Organization[edit]
  Chinese Academy of Sciences headquarters
See also: List of members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
The Chinese Academy originated in the Academia Sinica founded, in 1928, by the Republic of China. After the Communist Party took control of mainland China in 1949, the residual of Academia Sinica was renamed Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), while others relocated to Taiwan.
The Chinese Academy of Sciences has six academic divisions:

Chemistry (化学部)
Information Technological Sciences (信息技术科学部)
Earth Sciences (地学部)
Life Sciences and Medical Sciences (生命科学和医学学部)
Mathematics and Physics (数学物理学部)
Technological Sciences (技术科学部)
The CAS has thirteen regional branches, in Beijing, Shenyang, Changchun, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Hefei and Xinjiang.  It has over one hundred institutes and four universities (the University of Science and Technology of China at Hefei, Anhui, the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, ShanghaiTech University, and Shenzhen Institute of Adavanced Technology).  Backed by the institutes of CAS, UCAS is headquartered in Beijing, with graduate education bases in Shanghai, Chengdu, Wuhan, Guangzhou and Lanzhou, four Science Libraries of Chinese Academy of Sciences, three technology support centers and two news and publishing units.  These CAS branches and offices are located in 20 provinces and municipalities throughout China. CAS has invested in or created over 430 science- and technology-based enterprises in eleven industries, including eight companies listed on stock exchanges.
Being granted a Fellowship of the Academy represents the highest level of national honor for Chinese scientists. The CAS membership system includes Academicians (院士), Emeritus Academicians (荣誉院士) and Foreign Academicians (外籍院士).

Current President: Bai Chunli
Research reputation and rankings[edit]
The Chinese Academy of Sciences was ranked #1 in the 2016,[11][4] 2017,[12] 2018,[13] 2019,[14] and 2020 Nature Index Annual Tables, which measure the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[15][16]

Academy members[edit]
Main article: List of members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
See also: List of foreign members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
Membership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (also known by the title Academician (CAS), Chinese: 中国科学院院士) is a lifelong honor given to Chinese scientists who have made significant achievements in various fields. According to Bylaws for Members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences adopted in 1992 and recently amended in 2014, it is the highest academic title in China. A formal CAS member must hold Chinese citizenship, although foreigners can be elected as foreign CAS members. Members older than 80 are designated as "senior members" and may no longer hold leading positions in the organization.[17] Academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences carry an obligation to advance science and technology, to advocate and uphold scientific spirit, to develop a scientific and technological workforce, to attend member meetings and receive consultation and evaluation tasks, and to promote international exchanges and cooperation. Academicians can give suggestions and influence Chinese state policy related to science and technology.[18]

Scientific integrity[edit]
On 26 February 2007, CAS published a Declaration of Scientific Ideology and set up a commission for scientific integrity to promote transparency, autonomy and accountability of scientific research in the country. The Ministry of Science and Technology had at the same time also initiated measures to address misconduct in state-funded programs.[21]

Publications[edit]
Science ChinaLanguageEnglishStandard abbreviationsISO 4 (alt) · Bluebook (alt1 · alt2)NLM · MathSciNet ISO 4Sci. China
Together with the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the academy publishes the peer-reviewed academic journal, Science China (also known as Science in China). Science China comprises seven series:[22]

A: Mathematics
B: Chemistry
C: Life Sciences
D: Earth Sciences
E: Technological Sciences
F: Information Sciences
G: Physics, Mechanics and Astronomy
CAS also promotes the China Open Access Journals (COAJ) platform,[23] a national variant of the international Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).

Awards[edit]
Since 1999 the CAS has issued the annual State Preeminent Science and Technology Award, presented by the President of China to the recipient.[24]

International cooperation[edit]
The Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth is a branch of CAS. The Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth was a customer of Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), which provides data transmission services from satellites for a wide range of societal functions.[25] It was reported by Reuters on 21 September 2020 that SSC decided not to renew the contracts with China to help operate Chinese satellites from SSC's ground stations, or seek new business with China.[26]
