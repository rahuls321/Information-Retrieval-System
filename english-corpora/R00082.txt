The northwestern climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa sima), also known as the northwestern mushroomtongue salamander, is a species of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is endemic to Ecuador and found in the northwestern lowlands of the country at elevations below 1,000 m (3,300 ft) asl. It has been recorded in dense wet forest and in a grassy field, cleared for cattle grazing, although it is not known whether it could adapt to human-altered habitats. Agriculture and logging are threats to its habitat. It has been found in the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve.
