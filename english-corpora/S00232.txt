About[edit]
Zukerman was born in the United States but raised in Melbourne, Australia. She attended Monash University and received a biomedical science and law degree.[1][2] Her brother is actor Ashley Zukerman, and they were raised Jewish.[3]
She has worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on the documentary television program, Catalyst, and the consumer affairs television programThe Checkout.[4] Additionally, she has written for many different publications including New Scientist magazine,[5] Cosmos magazine,[6] The Age, The Australian, and Saturday Paper.[4][7]
In 2014 and 2015, she spoke at Storyology, an annual festival of journalism and media.[1] In March 2018, she spoke at a SXSW, in a panel event called, "What Podcasts Ate for Dinner".[8][9]
In 2021, Zukerman was amongst the first nominees of The Podcast Academy's new "Ambie" awards. She was one of seven nominees for the Best Host award.[10]

Science Vs[edit]
Since October 2015, her podcast Science Vs has been produced by Gimlet Media, a Brooklyn-based digital media company.[11][12][13] The show was previously produced and distributed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) as part of ABC Radio's First Run podcast program.[14][15] The podcast works on communicating science to non-scientists. The show takes a myth-busting approach, and topics on the show generally come from controversial topics or current events. Episode topics have included immigration, gun control, ghosts, climate change, acne, and antidepressants, among others.[15][16][17][18] Zukerman has said that the idea for Science Vs came from news headlines about Gwyneth Paltrow wanting women to participate in a "health practice" of vaginal steaming, which she thought could combine science with humor.[19] Zukerman summarized her podcast's position against false equivalences, saying, "If there's a 95 percent consensus among scientists, you report the consensus."[16]
