History[edit]
The city of Ghaziabad was founded in 1740 A.D. by Ghazi-ud-Din, who served as a wazir in the court of Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah, and named it as "Ghaziuddinnagar" after his own name.[10] The name "Ghaziuddinnagar" was shortened to its present form, i.e. "Ghaziabad" with the opening of the Railways in 1864.[11][12][13][14] During the Mughal period, Ghaziabad and especially the banks of the Hindon in Ghaziabad, remained a picnic spot for the Mughal royal family.[12]
Establishment of the Scientific Society here, during the same period is considered as a milestone of the educational movement launched by Syed Ahmad Khan.[15] The Scinde, Punjab & Delhi Railway, connecting Delhi and Lahore, up till Ambala through Ghaziabad was opened in the same year.[16] With the completion of the Amritsar-Saharanpur-Ghaziabad line of the Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway in 1870, Delhi was connected to Multan through Ghaziabad, and Ghaziabad became the junction of the East Indian Railway and Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway.[17]
Ghaziabad, along with Meerut and Bulandshahr, remained one of the three Munsifis of the District, under the Meerut Civil Judgeship during most periods of the British Raj.[18]
Ghaziabad was associated with the Indian independence movement from the Indian Rebellion of 1857.[11]

Economy[edit]

Although connected by railway since 1865, it was not until 1940 that the first modern industry appeared in Ghaziabad. However, it was in the post-independence period that industry really expanded, with a further 22 factories opening in the four years after 1947. This development can be attributed to the influx of people from the newly formed Pakistan and the relocation of businesses from what was now the Pakistani province of Punjab.[19] John Oakey and Mohan Ltd., one of India's largest concerns manufacturing coated and bonded abrasives, and originally functioning under the name of 'National Abrasives' at Rawalpindi was shifted here under the proprietorship of 'Dyer Meakins' in 1947.[20] Subsequently, the Mohan Meakin breweries were also set up in the year 1949.[21] This period also saw the development of Ghaziabad as one of India's most famous centres of the Oil Engines industry.[22]
In 1967, the municipal limits were extended up to the Delhi-UP border. Starting in the early 1970s, many steel-manufacturing units also came up in the city making it one of the primary industries of the city. This period also saw the emergence of the Electronics industry, with the setting up of Bharat Electronics Limited and Central Electronics Limited[23] Over the years, planned Industrial development saw participation from major industrial houses of the country including Mohans (Mohan Nagar Industrial Estate, 1949), Tatas (Tata Oil Mills), Modis (Modinagar, 1933; International Tobacco Co. 1967), Shri Rams (Shri Ram Pistons, 1964), Jaipurias etc. and also significant participation through foreign capital in concerns such as Danfoss India Ltd. (estd. 1968); Indo- Bulgar Food Ltd. and International Tobacco Company (estd. 1967).[24]

Demographics[edit]
Population[edit]
The provisional data derived from the 2011 census shows that Ghaziabad urban agglomeration had a population of 2,358,525, of which males were 1,256,783 and females were 1,101,742. The literacy rate was 93.81%.[25] Ghaziabad is a subcategory B1 district of category B i.e. having socioeconomic parameters below the national average.[26] It is the second largest industrial city in Uttar Pradesh after Kanpur.[27]

As it is connected to the national capital, its temperature and rainfall are similar to Delhi. Rajasthan's dust storms and snowfall in the Himalayas and Kumaon hills name their impact in the weather regularly. The monsoon arrives in the district at the end of June or the first week of July and normally it rains until October.
As in other districts of northern India mainly three seasons - summer, winter and rainy - prevail here, but sometimes due to severe snowfall in the Himalayas and Kumaon Hills, adverse weather can also be seen.
Due to a number of construction and highway projects causing cutting down hundreds of old trees rapidly, the pollution and rising temperature issues have increased significantly.

Government and politics[edit]
Ghaziabad city is governed by the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation under the Uttar Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1959.[28]  Ghaziabad city is spread over 210 km2 (81 sq mi) of municipal area.[29] It upgraded from a Municipal Board to a Municipal Corporation on 31 August 1994, following the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.[29] Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (or Nagar Nigam Ghaziabad) is divided into 5 zones - City Zone, Kavi Nagar Zone, Vijay Nagar Zone, Mohan Nagar Zone and Vasundhara Zone.[3] The Municipal Corporation comprises 100 wards, with councillors elected from each ward.[1][30] The local elections to all wards was last held in 2017.[31] The executive head is Mahendra Singh Tanwar, the current Municipal Commissioner[citation needed] while the elected head is the Mayor, Asha Sharma from the BJP.[32]
The municipality has the following departments: Swachh Bharat Mission, Public Works Dept, I.T Dept, Property Tax Dept, Health Dept, Street Light Dept, Water Works Dept, Law, Garden/Horticulture.[33] It has an executive committee composed of businessmen.[34]

As of 2019, Ghaziabad generates 1,000 metric tonnes of waste daily, some of which is sent to Meerut, while 300 metric tonnes are sent to Pilkhuwa, while almost 200 metric tons is used in various GMC owned parks to create compost.[43] The corporation also dumps garbage in Indirapuram landfill site, and would dump it in Pratap Vihar landfill till they stopped on the orders of a National Green Tribunal committee.[43] The corporation also announced in September 2020 that it was creating 10 'garbage factories[44]' as a permanent solution to the city's waste problem.
