In linear algebra, a Vandermonde matrix, named after Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde, is a matrix with the terms of a geometric progression in each row, i.e., an m × n matrix                    V        =                              [                                                            1                                                                      x                                          1                                                                                                            x                                          1                                                              2                                                                                        …                                                                      x                                          1                                                              n                      −                      1                                                                                                                    1                                                                      x                                          2                                                                                                            x                                          2                                                              2                                                                                        …                                                                      x                                          2                                                              n                      −                      1                                                                                                                    1                                                                      x                                          3                                                                                                            x                                          3                                                              2                                                                                        …                                                                      x                                          3                                                              n                      −                      1                                                                                                                    ⋮                                                  ⋮                                                  ⋮                                                  ⋱                                                  ⋮                                                                              1                                                                      x                                          m                                                                                                            x                                          m                                                              2                                                                                        …                                                                      x                                          m                                                              n                      −                      1                                                                                            ]                          ,              {\displaystyle V={\begin{bmatrix}1&x_{1}&x_{1}^{2}&\dots &x_{1}^{n-1}\\1&x_{2}&x_{2}^{2}&\dots &x_{2}^{n-1}\\1&x_{3}&x_{3}^{2}&\dots &x_{3}^{n-1}\\\vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\1&x_{m}&x_{m}^{2}&\dots &x_{m}^{n-1}\end{bmatrix}},}  or                              V                      i            ,            j                          =                  x                      i                                j            −            1                                        {\displaystyle V_{i,j}=x_{i}^{j-1}\,}  for all indices i and j. The identical term Vandermonde matrix was used for the transpose of the above matrix by Macon and Spitzbart (1958). The Vandermonde matrix used for the discrete Fourier transform matrix satisfies both definitions. The determinant of a square Vandermonde matrix (where m = n) can be expressed as                    det        (        V        )        =                  ∏                      1            ≤            i            <            j            ≤            n                          (                  x                      j                          −                  x                      i                          )        .              {\displaystyle \det(V)=\prod _{1\leq i<j\leq n}(x_{j}-x_{i}).}  This is called the Vandermonde determinant or Vandermonde polynomial. It is non-zero if and only if all                               x                      i                                {\displaystyle x_{i}}   are distinct.The Vandermonde determinant was sometimes called the discriminant, although, presently, the discriminant of a polynomial is the square of the Vandermonde determinant of the roots of the polynomial. The Vandermonde determinant is an alternating form in the                               x                      i                                {\displaystyle x_{i}}  , meaning that exchanging two                               x                      i                                {\displaystyle x_{i}}   changes the sign, while permuting the                               x                      i                                {\displaystyle x_{i}}   by an even permutation does not change the value of the determinant. It thus depends on the choice of an order for the                               x                      i                                {\displaystyle x_{i}}  , while its square, the discriminant, does not depend on any order, and this implies, by Galois theory, that the discriminant is a polynomial function of the coefficients of the polynomial that has the                               x                      i                                {\displaystyle x_{i}}   as roots.

The first one uses polynomial properties, especially the unique factorization property of multivariate polynomials. Although conceptually simple, it involves non-elementary concepts of abstract algebra. The second proof does not require any explicit computation, but involves the concepts of the determinant of a linear map and change of basis. It provides also the structure of the LU decomposition of the Vandermonde matrix. The third one is more elementary and more complicated, using only elementary row and column operations.= Using polynomial properties =By the Leibniz formula, det(V) is a polynomial in the                               x                      i                          ,              {\displaystyle x_{i},}   with integer coefficients. All entries of the ith column have total degree i – 1. Thus, again by the Leibniz formula, all terms of the determinant have total degree                     0        +        1        +        2        +        ⋯        +        (        n        −        1        )        =                                            n              (              n              −              1              )                        2                          ;              {\displaystyle 0+1+2+\cdots +(n-1)={\frac {n(n-1)}{2}};}  (that is the determinant is a homogeneous polynomial of this degree).If, for i ≠ j, one substitutes                               x                      i                                {\displaystyle x_{i}}   for                               x                      j                                {\displaystyle x_{j}}  , one gets a matrix with two equal rows, which has thus a zero determinant. Thus, by the factor theorem,                               x                      j                          −                  x                      i                                {\displaystyle x_{j}-x_{i}}   is a divisor of det(V). By the unique factorization property of multivariate polynomials, the product of all                               x                      j                          −                  x                      i                                {\displaystyle x_{j}-x_{i}}   divides det(V), that is                     det        (        V        )        =        Q                  ∏                      1            ≤            i            <            j            ≤            n                          (                  x                      j                          −                  x                      i                          )        ,              {\displaystyle \det(V)=Q\prod _{1\leq i<j\leq n}(x_{j}-x_{i}),}  where Q is a polynomial.

Moreover, one gets the LU decomposition of V as                    V        =        L                  U                      −            1                          .              {\displaystyle V=LU^{-1}.}  = By row and column operations =This third proof is based on the fact that if one adds to a column of a matrix the product by a scalar of another column then the determinant remains unchanged.So, by subtracting to each column – except the first one – the preceding column multiplied by                               x                      1                          ,              {\displaystyle x_{1},}   the determinant is not changed. (These subtractions must be done by starting from last columns, for subtracting a column that has not yet been changed).

distinct. An m × n rectangular Vandermonde matrix such that m ≥ n has maximum rank n if and only if there are n of the xi that are distinct. A square Vandermonde matrix is invertible if and only if the xi are distinct. An explicit formula for the inverse is known. Applications The Vandermonde matrix evaluates a polynomial at a set of points; formally, it is the matrix of the linear map that maps the vector of coefficients of a polynomial to the vector of the values of the polynomial at the values appearing in the Vandermonde matrix. The non-vanishing of the Vandermonde determinant for distinct points                               α                      i                                {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}   shows that, for distinct points, the map from coefficients to values at those points is a one-to-one correspondence, and thus that the polynomial interpolation problem is solvable with a unique solution; this result is called the unisolvence theorem, and is a special case of the Chinese remainder theorem for polynomials.This may be useful in polynomial interpolation, since inverting the Vandermonde matrix allows expressing the coefficients of the polynomial in terms of the                               α                      i                                {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}   and the values of the polynomial at the                               α                      i                                {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}  .However, the interpolation polynomial is generally easier to compute with the Lagrange interpolation formula, which may also be used for deriving a formula for the inverse of a Vandermonde matrix.The Vandermonde determinant is used in the representation theory of the symmetric group.When the values                               α                      k                                {\displaystyle \alpha _{k}}   belong to a finite field, then the Vandermonde determinant is also called a Moore determinant and has specific properties that are used, for example, in the theory of BCH code and Reed–Solomon error correction codes.The discrete Fourier transform is defined by a specific Vandermonde matrix, the DFT matrix, where the numbers αi are chosen to be roots of unity.The Laughlin wavefunction with filling factor one (appearing in the Quantum Hall effect), by the formula for the Vandermonde determinant, can be seen to be a Slater determinant. This is not true anymore for filling factors different from one, i.e., in the fractional Quantum Hall effect.It is the design matrix of polynomial regression. Confluent Vandermonde matrices As described before, a Vandermonde matrix describes the linear algebra interpolation problem of finding the coefficients of a polynomial                     p        (        x        )              {\displaystyle p(x)}   of degree                     n        −        1              {\displaystyle n-1}   based on the values                     p        (                  α                      1                          )        ,                .        .        .        ,                p        (                  α                      n                          )              {\displaystyle p(\alpha _{1}),\,...,\,p(\alpha _{n})}  , where                               α                      1                          ,                .        .        .        ,                          α                      n                                {\displaystyle \alpha _{1},\,...,\,\alpha _{n}}   are distinct points. If                               α                      i                                {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}   are not distinct, then this problem does not have a unique solution (which is reflected by the fact that the corresponding Vandermonde matrix is singular). However, if we give the values of the derivatives at the repeated points, then the problem can have a unique solution. For example, the problem                                          {                                                            p                  (                  0                  )                  =                  a                                                                                                  p                    ′                                    (                  0                  )                  =                  b                                                                              p                  (                  1                  )                  =                  c                                                                                      {\displaystyle {\begin{cases}p(0)=a\\p'(0)=b\\p(1)=c\end{cases}}}  where                     p              {\displaystyle p}   is a polynomial of degree ≤ 2, has a unique solution for all                     a        ,        b        ,        c              {\displaystyle a,b,c}  . In general, suppose that                               α                      1                          ,                  α                      2                          ,        .        .        .        ,                  α                      n                                {\displaystyle \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},...,\alpha _{n}}   are (not necessarily distinct) numbers, and suppose for ease of notation that equal values come in continuous sequences in the list. That is                              α                      1                          =        ⋯        =                  α                                    m                              1                                                    ,                           α                                    m                              1                                      +            1                          =        ⋯        =                  α                                    m                              2                                                    ,                 …        ,                           α                                    m                              k                −                1                                      +            1                          =        ⋯        =                  α                                    m                              k                                                          {\displaystyle \alpha _{1}=\cdots =\alpha _{m_{1}},\ \alpha _{m_{1}+1}=\cdots =\alpha _{m_{2}},\ \ldots ,\ \alpha _{m_{k-1}+1}=\cdots =\alpha _{m_{k}}}  where                               m                      k                          =        n        ,              {\displaystyle m_{k}=n,}                                 m                      1                          <                  m                      2                          <        ⋯        <                  m                      k                          ,              {\displaystyle m_{1}<m_{2}<\cdots <m_{k},}   and                               α                                    m                              1                                                    ,        …        ,                  α                                    m                              k                                                          {\displaystyle \alpha _{m_{1}},\ldots ,\alpha _{m_{k}}}   are distinct.

Its rows are derivatives (of some order) of the original Vandermonde rows.Another way to receive this formula is to let some of the                               α                      i                                {\displaystyle \alpha _{i}}  's go arbitrarily close to each other. For example, if                               α                      1                          =                  α                      2                                {\displaystyle \alpha _{1}=\alpha _{2}}  , then letting                               α                      2                          →                  α                      1                                {\displaystyle \alpha _{2}\to \alpha _{1}}   in the original Vandermonde matrix, the difference between the first and second rows yields the corresponding row in the confluent Vandermonde matrix. This allows us to link the generalized interpolation problem (given value and derivatives on a point) to the original case where all points are distinct: Being given                     p        (        α        )        ,                  p          ′                (        α        )              {\displaystyle p(\alpha ),p'(\alpha )}   is similar to being given                     p        (        α        )        ,        p        (        α        +        ε        )              {\displaystyle p(\alpha ),p(\alpha +\varepsilon )}   where                     ε              {\displaystyle \varepsilon }   is very small.
