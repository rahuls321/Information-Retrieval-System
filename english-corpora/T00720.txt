Get in[edit][add listing]The park is 25 km from Khajuraho, a World Heritage Site which is half an hour drive from Madla Entry Point.  Hinouta, the second gate of the park is 20 km from Panna town.   Khajuraho is the nearest airport which is directly connected to New Delhi.  Taxis are available all the time from Khajuraho to Panna.


Fees and permits[edit]
Get around[edit][add listing]You can take an elephant ride into the tiger reserve, but the real fun is when you go out in a jeep on the tiger-hunt. One can easily spend a day or two at this park.
The price is ₹2000 per vehicle and half-day, plus 150 for the compulsory guide. They open at 06:00, so make sure you are there slightly before that if you want to see any tigers! Sometimes there is an annoying wait when they try to print your ticket. +91 7732-252 135
