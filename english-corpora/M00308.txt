Otherwise one says it is irreducible.If                     V              {\displaystyle V}   is of finite dimension                     r              {\displaystyle r}   and                     W              {\displaystyle W}   is a reducing subspace of the map                     T        :        V        →        V              {\displaystyle T:V\to V}   represented under basis                     B              {\displaystyle B}   by matrix                     M        ∈                              R                                r            ×            r                                {\displaystyle M\in \mathbb {R} ^{r\times r}}   then                     M              {\displaystyle M}   can be expressed as the sumwhere                               P                      W                          ∈                              R                                r            ×            r                                {\displaystyle P_{W}\in \mathbb {R} ^{r\times r}}   is the matrix of the orthogonal projection from                     V              {\displaystyle V}   to                     W              {\displaystyle W}   and                               P                                    W                              ⊥                                                    =        I        −                  P                      W                                {\displaystyle P_{W^{\perp }}=I-P_{W}}   is the matrix of the projection onto                               W                      ⊥                          .              {\displaystyle W^{\perp }.}    (Here                     I        ∈                              R                                r            ×            r                                {\displaystyle I\in \mathbb {R} ^{r\times r}}   is the identity matrix.)Furthermore,                     V              {\displaystyle V}   has an orthonormal basis                               B          ′                      {\displaystyle B'}   with a subset that is an orthonormal basis of                     W              {\displaystyle W}  .
