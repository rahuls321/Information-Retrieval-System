Mission[edit]
The mission of 314 Action is to connect people with backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, and math to the skills and funding needed for a successful political campaign.[1][2]
The group is characterized as a liberal and Democratic-leaning group since 314 Action uses ActBlue as its payment processing platform and mostly targets Republican-held federal and state positions in its campaigns.[citation needed]

Founding[edit]
The organization was founded in 2016 by researcher Shaughnessy Naughton.[3][4] Naughton is a business owner and a chemist who ran for Congress in Pennsylvania in 2014.[5]

Name[edit]
The group gets its name from pi (π), a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14.[1]
