History[edit]
Daily Planet first aired on January 1, 1995, the same day as the premiere of Discovery Channel Canada, under the name @discovery.ca, it was an hour-long daily news magazine with a science news segment and several feature segments. During this era, the show aired for the fall/winter season. The summer season aired the variant show Summer@discovery.ca, with the daily science news segment, and repeats of feature segments from the fall/winter season in a half-hour format.[3][4] On September 30, 2002, it was relaunched as Daily Planet, adopting a "science magazine" programming format.
Jay Ingram, who hosted the show since Discovery Channel Canada's inception, announced his retirement on May 16, 2011.[5] Daily Planet: Jay's Last Show aired on Sunday, June 5, 2011, which paid tribute to the host with flashbacks and guest segments.[6]
Previous co-hosts include Gill Deacon (1996-2002), Natasha Stillwell, who left the show on February 2, 2007,[7] temporary co-host Patty Kim, and Kim Jagtiani, who left in September 2008.

Set design[edit]
During the summer of 2002, the set was completely remade for the name change from @discovery.ca to Daily Planet. During the summer of 2006, the set of Daily Planet was completely made over. On the season premiere in September, the end of the show was about the rebuilding of the set. During the summer of 2011 the set was rebuilt to accommodate the relaunch of the show in high definition on August 29, 2011.

Foreign versions[edit]

An American version of the series, Science Daily, which was based in Washington, DC, aired on the Discovery-owned digital channel The Science Channel (then branded Discovery Science Channel) from 2000–2001, during the @discovery.ca era.

The Science Channel more recently simulcasted a live Daily Planet special called Mars: The Phoenix Lands in HD on May 25, 2008.
International versions of Daily Planet are also produced for Discovery Channel (United States) Discovery Channel Latin America and Discovery Channel Asia.
