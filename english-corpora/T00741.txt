Understand[edit]Ranganathittu covers an area of less than 1 km², but the bird population density is very high. The most common birds in the sanctuary are painted storks, spoon bills, white ibises, egrets, herons and partridges. Most of the birds stay on tiny islands within the river, which you can approach by boat. However, the river is also home to a few crocodiles, so don't jump in for a swim!
The best times to visit are from March to May.
History[edit]Ranganathittu attained the status of a bird sanctuary in 1940, courtesy of the visions of India's noted ornithologist. Dr. Salim Ali. who, during his survey of the birds of Mysore, advocated for the establishment of such a sanctuary.
Landscape[edit]Ranganthittu is on the river Cauvery, about 13 km away from Mysore. The part that visitors are allowed to see is a slow section of the river, with many little islands which form nesting sites for sorts of migratory birds. Low hanging branches, small rocks with crocodiles sunning themselves are easily found, so don't be surprised if you look around to see a crocodile within arm's reach. This sanctuary is well maintained with tiled footpaths and photogenic niches in the small space.
  White Ibis flockFlora and fauna[edit]Some of the birds seen at Ranganthittu are the white Ibis, cormorants, egrets, herons, river terns and darters. In addition, the place is also home to a large number of crocodiles.

See[edit][add listing]The local fauna:
Birds[edit][add listing]Many little islands in the river form nesting sites for sorts of migratory birds. Low hanging branches, allow for easy visibility. Nearly 180 birds have been recorded here over the years. Some of the birds seen at Ranganathittu include the white Ibis, cormorants, egrets, herons, river terns, and darters. There is a  machan (an elevated wooden platform where you can sit and watch wildlife) at the end of the walkway which offers close up views of the nesting sites.
Crocodiles[edit][add listing]It is also home to a large number of marsh crocodiles. Small rocks with crocodiles sunning themselves are easily found, so don't be surprised if you look around to see a crocodile within arm's reach.






Do[edit][add listing]Take a boat ride. Weekends can be very crowded and you may have a long wait. The boat rides start start at 8:30AM. The best time to view the birds is at dawn and dusk. Otherwise the only thing you can do is watch birds from the shore, which will require a really good pair of binoculars. If you do the boat ride, you can get really close to the birds and the nests. If you are lucky, you get to see a nest with baby birds at eye level.

Eat[edit][add listing]There is a small cafe at Ranganthittu, and Mysore is always close by. A canteen at the sanctuary sells tea, coffee and snacks like Masala Dosai. The canteen is set up in a beautiful way.


Drink[edit][add listing]No drinking or smoking allowed in the park.


Sleep[edit][add listing]There is no lodging at the park itself, but you can stay in Srirangapatna, a few kilometres away, or better yet, Mysore.


Stay safe[edit]Beware of crocodiles in the river.


Respect[edit]The sanctuary is suffering from a plastic problem. Please avoid leaving any plastic bags. They not only make the place look untidy, but can be deadly to the wildlife.
