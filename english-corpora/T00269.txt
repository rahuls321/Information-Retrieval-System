Shri Kshetra Manjuguni[edit]
Manjuguni is one of the popular pilgrim centers located in the Uttara Kannada (North Kanara) district of Karnataka state. This place is located at a distance of 26 km from Sirsi. The temple here is dedicated to Lord Venkataramana and Goddess Padmavathi. Devotees believe that, Manjuguni is called as "Tirupati of karnataka".[citation needed] The temple is situated in western ghat belt, popularly known as Sahyadri hills. During winter, this place is covered by thick fog (in Kannada: Manju) and hence it is called by the name 'Manjuguni'. The temple of Lord Venkatramana is a huge complex built in Vijayanagara Style.
According to "Sri Venkatesha Mahatmya" the founder of this temple is 'Tirumala Yogi', a saint.[citation needed]

Jain Matha[edit]
