Having been bent upon mounting Suvela, Rāma, followed by Lakşmaņa, addressed in sweet and excellent words, Sugriva, and that righteous night-ranger, Vibhisana, versed in। counsel and conversant with precepts, who was devoted to him, saying. We shall all ascend this mount Suvela, be dight with metals; and pass this night even here. And (from here) will we view the abode of that Raksasa who, foul of soul, has carried off my spouse, to bring destruction down on himself, who knows normorality not good conduct nor behaviour (conducive to the dignity of his descent), and who, in consequence of his base propensity, has committed himself to so heinous a course of action. Having decided thus, Rāma, filled with wrath at Ravana, coming to Suvela, ascended its variegated plateau. And Laksmana, collected, went in his wake. And, upraising bow and arrow, Sugriva, (ever) engaged in valorous acts, accompanied with Vibhişaņa as well as his counsellors, following him, also ascended (the mountain). And all those rangers of mountains, gifted with the vehemence of the Wind in hundreds ascended mount Suvela, where Rāghava was stationed. Ascending the mountain in a short time, they all beheld from its summit the city, appearing to be built on the air. And the monkey-leaders beheld Lankā, exceedingly splendid with noble gateways; gracefully enclosed with a wall; thronging with Rakşasas; and defended by sable Raksasas. The foremost of monkeys saw these appearing like another wall (overtopping the one beneath). On seeing the Rākşasas, the monkeys burning for battle set up various roars in the presence of Rama. Then the Sun, crimsoned with Eve, ascended the Setting-hill; and Night came, illumined by the Moon at his full. Then the master of the monkey-army, Rāma, saluted and honoured by Vibhisana, accompanied by Lakşmaņa as well as the leaders of the monkeys, sojourned happily on the beast of Suvela.
