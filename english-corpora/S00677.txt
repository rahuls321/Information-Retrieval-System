This is a list of "laws" applied to various disciplines. These are often adages or predictions with the appellation 'Law', although they do not apply in the legal sense, cannot be scientifically tested, or are intended only as rough descriptions (rather than applying in each case). These 'laws' are sometimes called rules of thumb.
See List of legal topics for 'laws' in the legal sense.
See List of scientific laws for falsifiable laws that are said to apply universally and literally.
