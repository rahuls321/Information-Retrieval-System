SECTION I
(Anusasanika Parva)
OM! HAVING BOWED down unto Narayana, and Nara the foremost of male
beings, and unto the goddess Saraswati, must the word Jaya be uttered.
"Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, tranquillity of mind has been said to
be subtile and of diverse forms. I have heard all thy discourses, but
still tranquillity of mind has not been mine. In this matter, various
means of quieting the mind have been related (by thee), O sire, but how
can peace of mind be secured from only a knowledge of the different kinds
of tranquillity, when I myself have been the instrument of bringing about
all this? Beholding thy body covered with arrows and festering with bad
sores, I fail to find, O hero, any peace of mind, at the thought of the
evils I have wrought. Beholding thy body, O most valiant of men, bathed
in blood, like a hill overrun with water from its springs, I am
languishing with grief even as the lotus in the rainy season. What can be
more painful than this, that thou, O grandsire, hast been brought to this
plight on my account by my people fighting against their foes on the
battle-field? Other princes also, with their sons and kinsmen, having met
with destruction on my account. Alas, what can be more painful than this.
Tell us, O prince, what destiny awaits us and the sons of Dhritarashtra,
who, driven by fate and anger, have done this abhorrent act. O lord of
men, I think the son of Dhritarashtra is fortunate in that he doth not
behold thee in this state. But I, who am the cause of thy death as well
as of that of our friends, am denied all peace of mind by beholding thee
on the bare earth in this sorry condition. The wicked Duryodhana, the
most infamous of his race, has, with all his troops and his brothers,
perished in battle, in the observance of Kshatriya duties. That
wicked-souled wight does not see thee lying on the ground. Verily, for
this reason, I would deem death to be preferable to life. O hero that
never swervest from virtue, had I with my brothers met with destruction
ere this at the hands of our enemies on the battle-field, I would not
have found thee in this pitiful plight, thus pierced with arrows. Surely,
O prince, the Maker had created is to become perpetrators of evil deeds.
O king, if thou wishest to do me good, do thou then instruct me in such a
way that I may be cleansed of this sin in even another world.'
"Bhishma replied, 'Why, O fortunate one, dost thou consider thy soul,
which is dependent (on God and Destiny and Time) to be the cause of thy
actions? The manifestation of its inaction is subtle and imperceptible to
the senses. In this connection is cited the ancient story of the
conversation between Mrityu and Gautami with Kala and the Fowler and the
serpent. There was, O son of Kunti, an old lady of the name of Gautami,
who was possessed of great patience and tranquillity of mind. One day she
found her son dead in consequence of having been bitten by a serpent. An
angry fowler, by name Arjunaka, bound the serpent with a string and
brought it before Gautami. He then said to her,--This wretched serpent
has been the cause of thy son's death, O blessed lady. Tell me quickly
how this wretch is to be destroyed. Shall I throw it into the fire or
shall I hack it into pieces? This infamous destroyer of a child does not
deserve to live longer.'
"Gautami replied, 'Do thou, O Arjunaka of little understanding, release
this serpent. It doth not deserve death at thy hands. Who is so foolish
as to disregard the inevitable lot that awaits him and burdening himself
with such folly sink into sin? Those that have made themselves light by
the practice of virtuous deeds, manage to cross the sea of the world even
as a ship crosses the ocean. But those that have made themselves heavy
with sin sink into the bottom, even as an arrow thrown into the water. By
killing the serpent, this my boy will not be restored to life, and by
letting it live, no harm will be caused to thee. Who would go to the
interminable regions of Death by slaying this living creature?'
"The fowler said, 'I know, O lady that knowest the difference between
right and wrong, that the great are afflicted at the afflictions of all
creatures. But these words which thou hast spoken are fraught with
instruction for only a self-contained person (and not for one plunged in
sorrow). Therefore, I must kill this serpent. Those who value peace of
mind, assign everything to the course of Time as the cause, but practical
men soon assuage their grief (by revenge). People through constant
delusion, fear loss of beatitude (in the next world for acts like these).
therefore, O lady, assuage thy grief by having this serpent destroyed (by
me).
"Gautami replied, 'People like us are never afflicted by (such
misfortune). Good men have their souls always intent on virtue. The death
of the boy was predestined: therefore, I am unable to approve of the
destruction of this serpent. Brahmanas do not harbour resentment, because
resentment leads to pain. Do thou, O good man, forgive and release this
serpent out of compassion.'
"The fowler replied, 'Let us earn great and inexhaustible merit hereafter
by killing (this creature), even as a man acquires great merit, and
confers it on his victim sacrificed as well, by sacrifice upon the altar.
Merit is acquired by killing an enemy: by killing this despicable
creature, thou shalt acquire great and true merit hereafter.'
"Gautami replied, 'What good is there in tormenting and killing an enemy,
and what good is won by not releasing an enemy in our power? Therefore, O
thou of benign countenance, why should we not forgive this serpent and
try to earn merit by releasing it?'
"The fowler replied, 'A great number (of creatures) ought to be protected
from (the wickedness of) this one, instead of this single creature being
protected (in preference to many). Virtuous men abandon the vicious (to
their doom): do thou, therefore, kill this wicked creature.'
"Gautami replied, 'By killing this serpent, O fowler, my son will not be
restored to life, nor do I see that any other end will be attained by its
death: therefore, do thou, O fowler, release this living creature of a
serpent.
"The fowler said, 'By killing Vritra, Indra secured the best portion (of
sacrificial offerings), and by destroying a sacrifice Mahadeva secured
his share of sacrificial offerings: do thou, therefore, destroy this
serpent immediately without any misgivings in thy mind!'
"Bhishma continued, 'The high-souled Gautami, although repeatedly incited
by the fowler for the destruction of the serpent did not bend her mind to
that sinful act. The serpent, painfully bound with the cord: sighing a
little and maintaining its composure with great difficulty, then uttered
these words slowly, in a human voice.'
"The serpent said, 'O foolish Arjunaka, what fault is there of mine? I
have no will of my own, and am not independent. Mrityu sent me on this
errand. By his direction have I bitten this child, and not out of any
anger or choice on my part. Therefore, if there be any sin in this, O
fowler, the sin is his.'
"The fowler said, 'If thou hast done this evil, led thereto by another,
the sin is thine also as thou art an instrument in the act. As in the
making of an earthen vessel the potter's wheel and rod and other things
are all regarded as causes, so art thou, O serpent, (cause in the
production of this effect). He that is guilty deserves death at my hands.
Thou, O serpent, art guilty. Indeed, thou confessest thyself so in this
matter!'
"The serpent said, 'As all these, viz., the potter's wheel, rod, and
other things, are not independent causes, even so I am not an independent
cause. Therefore, this is no fault of mine, as thou shouldst grant.
Shouldst thou think otherwise, then these are to be considered as causes
working in unison with one another. For thus working with one other, a
doubt arises regarding their relation as cause and effect. Such being the
case, it is no fault of mine, nor do I deserve death on this account, nor
am I guilty of any sin. Or, if thou thinkest that there is sin (in even
such causation), the sin lies in the aggregate of causes.'
"The fowler said, 'If thou art neither the prime cause nor the agent in
this matter, thou art still the cause of the death (of his child).
Therefore, thou dost deserve death in my opinion. If, O serpent, thou
thinkest that when an evil act is done, the doer is not implicated
therein, then there can be no cause in this matter; but having done this,
verily thou deservest death. What more dost thou think?'
"The serpent said, 'Whether any cause exists or not,[1] no effect is
produced without an (intermediate) act. Therefore, causation being of no
moment in either case, my agency only as the cause (in this matter) ought
to be considered in its proper bearings. If, O fowler, thou thinkest me
to be the cause in truth, then the guilt of this act of killing a living
being rests on the shoulders of another who incited me to this end.'[2]
"The fowler said, 'Not deserving of life, O foolish one, why dost thou
bandy so many words, O wretch of a serpent? Thou deservest death at my
hands. Thou hast done an atrocious act by killing this infant.'
"The serpent said, 'O fowler, as the officiating priests at a sacrifice
do not acquire the merit of the act by offering oblations of clarified
butter to the fire, even so should I be regarded with respect as to the
result in this connection.'
"Bhishma continued, 'The serpent directed by Mrityu having said this,
Mrityu himself appeared there and addressing the serpent spoke thus.
"Mrityu said, 'Guided. by Kala, I, O serpent, sent thee on this errand,
and neither art thou nor am I the cause of this child's death. Even as
the clouds are tossed hither and thither by the wind, I am like the
clouds, O serpent, influenced by Kala. All attitudes appertaining to
Sattwa or Rajas, or Tamas, are provoked by Kala, and operate in all
creatures. All creatures, mobile and immobile, in heaven, or earth, are
influenced by Kala. The whole universe, O serpent, is imbued with this
same influence of Kala. All acts in this world and all abstentions, as
also all their modifications, are said to be influenced by Kala, Surya,
Soma, Vishnu, Water, Wind, the deity of a hundred sacrificer, Fire, Sky,
Earth, Mitra and Parjanya, Aditi, and the Vasus, Rivers and Oceans, all
existent and non-existent objects, are created and destroyed by Kala.
Knowing this, why dost thou, O serpent, consider me to be guilty? If any
fault attaches to me in this, thou also wouldst be to blame.'
"The serpent said, 'I do not, O Mrityu, blame thee, nor do I absolve thee
from all blame. I only aver that I am directed and influenced (in my
actions) by thee. If any blame attaches to Kala, or, if it be not
desirable to attach any blame to him, it is not for me to scan the fault.
We have no right to do so. As it is incumbent on me to absolve myself
from this blame, so it is my duty to see that no blame attaches to
Mrityu.'
"Bhishma continued, 'Then the serpent, addressing Arjunaka, said--Thou
hast listened to what Mrityu has said. Therefore, it is not proper for
thee to torment me, who am guiltless, by tying me with this cord.'
"The fowler said, 'I have listened to thee, O serpent, as well as to the
words of Mrityu, but these, O serpent, do not absolve thee from all
blame. Mrityu and thyself are the causes of the child's death. I consider
both of you to be the cause and I do not call that to be the cause which
is not truly so. Accursed be the wicked and vengeful Mrityu that causes
affliction to the good. Thee too I shall kill that art sinful and
engaged, in sinful acts!'
"Mrityu said, 'We both are not free agents, but are dependent on Kala,
and ordained to do our appointed work. Thou shouldst not find fault with
us if thou dost consider this matter thoroughly.'
"The fowler said, 'If ye both, O serpent and Mrityu, be dependent on
Kala, I am curious to know how pleasure (arising from doing good) and
anger (arising from doing evil) are caused.'
"Mrityu said, 'Whatever is done is done under the influence of Kala. I
have said it before, O fowler, that Kala is the cause of all and that for
this reason we both, acting under the inspiration of Kala, do our
appointed work and therefore, O fowler, we two do not deserve censure
from thee in any way!'
"Bhishma continued, 'Then Kala arrived at that scene of disputation on
this point of morality, and spoke thus to the serpent and Mrityu and the
fowler Arjunaka assembled together.'
"Kala said, 'Neither Mrityu, nor this serpent, nor I, O fowler, am guilty
of the death of any creature. We are merely the immediate exciting causes
of the event. O Arjunaka, the Karma of this child formed the exciting
cause of our action in this matter. There was no other cause by which
this child came by its death. It was killed as a result of its own Karma.
It has met with death as the result of its Karma in the past. Its Karma
has been the cause of its destruction. We all are subject to the
influence of our respective Karma. Karma is an aid to salvation even as
sons are, and Karma also is an indicator of virtue and vice in man. We
urge one another even as acts urge one another. As men make from a lump
of clay whatever they wish to make, even so do men attain to various
results determined by Karma. As light and shadow are related to each
other, so are men related to Karma through their own actions. Therefore,
neither art thou, nor am I, nor Mrityu, nor the serpent, nor this old
Brahmana lady, is the cause of this child's death. He himself is the
cause here. Upon Kala, O king, expounding the matter in this way,
Gautami, convinced in her mind that men suffer according to their
actions, spoke thus to Arjunaka.'
"Gautami said, 'Neither Kala, nor Mrityu, nor the serpent, is the cause
in this matter. This child has met with death as the result of its own
Karma. I too so acted (in the past) that my son has died (as its
consequence). Let now Kala and Mrityu retire from this place, and do thou
too, O Arjunaka, release this serpent.'
"Bhishma continued, 'Then Kala and Mrityu and the serpent went back to
their respective destinations, and Gautami became consoled in mind as
also the fowler. Having heard all this, O king, do thou forego all grief,
and attain to peace of mind. Men attain to heaven or hell as the result
of their own Karma. This evil has neither been of thy own creation, nor
of Duryodhana's. Know this that these lords of Earth have all been slain
(in this war) as a result of acts of Kalas.'"
Vaisampayana said, "Having heard all this, the powerful and virtuous
Yudhishthira became consoled in mind, and again enquired as follows."
