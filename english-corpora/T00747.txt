Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, popularly known as the Muthanga Wildlife Sanctuary, is an animal sanctuary in the Wayanad District of Kerala in India.


Understand[edit]
It is the second largest wildlife sanctuary in Kerala, and was established in 1973. It is part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. It is a rain forest reserve connected to two major sanctuaries - Bandipur National Park to the north in Karnataka and Mudumalai National Park in Tamil Nadu.

Landscape[edit]
The landscape is mountainous with lush forests typical of the western ghats.

Flora and fauna[edit]
It has a large population of elephants, and has been declared a Project Elephant Site. The reserve is also home to a small population of tigers. Panthers, jungle cats, civet cats, monkeys, wild dogs, bison, deer, bears, monitor lizards and a variety of snakes are seen. There is also a profusion of birds, butterflies and insects. 
Moist deciduous forest consists of maruthi, karimaruthi, rosewood, venteak, vengal, chadachi, mazhukanjiram, bamboos, while the semi-evergreen patches comprises veteria indica, lagerstroemia, lanceolata, termianalia paniculata. Crocodile bark tree and the invasive species of Senna are omnipresent.

Get around[edit]
Safari trips into the forest are conducted by the forest office daily in two batches, one in the morning (7AM-9AM) and one in the afternoon (3PM-5PM). It is best to go as early as possible in these slots to be able to do some sightings, as the animals retire during the hot sun. The safari is done in jeep, and the officials are happy to guide you around the sights in the forest. A maximum of 200 safaris are allowed per batch, so make sure you are early enough if going on a holiday. 

See[edit]
As with any safari trip, sightings are a matter of luck. The earlier you go in either the morning or evening slot, the more chances you have of spotting animals. Look out for elephants, three types of deer, leopards, panthers, jungle cats, civet cats, monkeys, wild dogs, boar, porcupine, vultures, long-tailed drongos, mongoose, bison, black bear, monitor lizards and a variety of snakes like pythons and vipers. There is also a profusion of butterflies and insects. 
There is a new wildlife museum near the forest entrance where you can view facts and displays on the sanctuary.
