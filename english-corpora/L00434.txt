Her young adult novels are typically about coming of age issues such as teenage sexuality.The Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling was the most challenged work from 2000 to 2009. Its topics relating to things such as witchcraft have generated controversy.The second oldest works featured on the list were written by Mark Twain. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) is challenged consistently for its language and discussion of racism.
This list of the most commonly challenged books in the United States refers to books sought to be removed or otherwise restricted from public access, typically from a library or a school curriculum. This list is primarily based on U.S. data gathered by the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF), which gathers data from media reports, and from reports from librarians and teachers.[1]
As of 2020, the top ten reasons books were challenged and banned books included sexual content (92.5% percent of books on the list); offensive language (61.5%); unsuited to age group (49%); religious viewpoint (26%); LGBTQIA+ content (23.5%); violence (19%); racism (16.5%); drugs, alcohol, and smoking (12.5%); "anti-family" content (7%); and political viewpoint (6.5%).[2][3][4][better source needed]

List[edit]
Since 2001, the American Library Association has posed the top ten most frequently challenged books per year on their website.[4] Using the Radcliffe Publishing Course Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century, ALA has also noted banned and challenged classics.[5]
The list is sorted alphabetically by default. Included is each book's rank in the ALA's lists of top 100 challenged books by decade (if applicable).
