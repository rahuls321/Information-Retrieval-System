Early life and education
Walensky was born Rochelle Paula Bersoff in Peabody, Massachusetts,[3] to Edward Bersoff and Carol Bersoff-Bernstein, a Jewish family.[4] She was raised in Potomac, Maryland.[5][6]
In 1991, Walensky received a B.A. in biochemistry and molecular biology from Washington University in St. Louis.[6] In 1995, she received an M.D. degree from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. From 1995 to 1998, she trained in internal medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Walensky then became a fellow in the Massachusetts General Hospital/Brigham and Women's Hospital Infectious Diseases Fellowship Program. In 2001, she earned an MPH in clinical effectiveness from the Harvard School of Public Health.[7]

Academic career
Walensky had been on the faculty of Harvard Medical School since 2001, first as an instructor, then as a professor.[8] Walensky was a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School from 2012-2020, and served as chief of the division of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2017-2020. She served on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic and conducted research on vaccine delivery and strategies to reach underserved communities. Walensky has worked to improve HIV screening and care in South Africa, led health policy initiatives, and researched clinical trial design and evaluation in a variety of settings.[9]
Walensky was Chair of the Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council at the National Institutes of Health from 2014 to 2015 and has served as a member of the US Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents since 2011.[10] She serves on the board of directors of Mass General Brigham.[11] She has been co-director of the Medical Practice Evaluation Center at Massachusetts General Hospital since 2011.[10]

COVID-19
In a paper published in Health Affairs in November 2020, Walensky and her co-authors showed that the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine will be strongly affected by:

The speed with which the vaccine is produced and administered. Some of the potential vaccines have logistical challenges including the need for ultra-cold storage or requiring two doses.
The willingness of people to be vaccinated.
The pandemic's severity when the vaccine is introduced.[12]
CDC Director
The Biden transition announced Walensky's presumptive appointment as CDC director on December 7, 2020.[13] Doctors and public health experts widely praised the choice.[14] As the position of director of the CDC does not require Senate confirmation to take office,[15] Walensky's tenure at the CDC began on January 20, 2021.
On August 3, 2021, Walensky instituted a 60-day extension of a federal COVID-related ban, which had just expired, on landlords evicting their tenants. The extended ban applied only to "counties experiencing substantial and high levels of community transmission levels", but under the criteria of the ban this covered an area holding 90% of the U.S. population.[16] On August 26, as was widely expected,[17] the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the extension as unconstitutional, ruling that only the U.S. Congress had the authority to issue such a moratorium.[18]
As the pandemic entered the Omicron wave, Walensky has acknowledged that officials on the CDC response team are burned out[19] and tried to reassign workers. However, just months [before Omicron], Walensky and other top officials had a plan to dissolve large parts of the pandemic response team, which has more than 1,500 staffers, & reassign members to their original posts. Walensky shelved the plan with the emergence of Omicron as cases began to tick up across the U.S.[20], bringing morale lower than ever at the CDC. However, Ashish Jha says, "Dr. Walensky inherited a really messy organization with some real strengths but also a lot of problems.”[21]
During a January 26, 2022 news conference about the rise of the Omicron variant and high hospitalization rates, Dr. Walensky said the nation should not ease up on COVID-19 safety protocols, saying, "Milder does not mean mild and we cannot look past the strain on our health systems and substantial number of deaths." She also sais, "It’s important to remember we’re still facing a high overall burden of disease."[22]

Response to criticism
In a January 18, 2022 interview with The Boston Globe, Walensky defended her first year at the CDC describing her critics as "naysayers" who have helped sow the public confusion she has been accused of creating and pointing out that many Americans are still not following the most basic guidance on COVID-19 prevention. She also said, "We’re making decisions in imperfect times, sometimes without all the data that we would like to make them.”  Walensky acknowledged she is now working with a messaging coach and she is listening to her critics. She noted that better communication is not always possible saying, "Some of this is not based on the messaging because, 'Wear a mask' is about as crystal clear as you could be. And still we have much of America not doing it. So some of the really easy stuff is not being followed, and some of the harder stuff is actually complicated science."[23]

Personal life
Walensky is married to Loren D. Walensky, also a physician-scientist. They have three sons.[24] They are Jewish and members of Temple Emanuel in Newton, Massachusetts.[25]
