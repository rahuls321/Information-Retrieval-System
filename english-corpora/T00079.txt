Shekhawati is a semi-arid historical region located in the northeast part of Rajasthan, India. The region was ruled by Shekhawat Rajputs.
Shekhawati is located in North Rajasthan, comprising the districts of Jhunjhunu, Sikar, Churu  and Jaipur. It is bounded on the northwest by the Bikaner region, on the northeast by Haryana, on the east by Mewat, on the southeast by Dhundhar, on the south by Ajmer, and on the southwest by the Marwar region. Its area is 13784 square kilometers.[1]
In the 17th to 19th centuries, Marwari merchants constructed grand havelis in the Shekhawati region. Steeped with wealth and affluence, the merchants attempted to outdo others by building more grand edifices – homes, temples, and step wells which both inside and outside were richly decorated  with painted murals.[2]

Etymology of Shekhawati[edit]
Shekhawati was first mentioned in the book Bankidas ki Khyat.[3] A contemporary of Bankidas was Colonel W.S. Gardener, who used the word Shekhawati in 1803. Later James Tod wrote the first history of Shekhawati. The term Shekhawati was used frequently in Vamsh Bhaskar.[4] Shekhawati is named after Rao Shekha.

History[edit]
Ancient history[edit]
Main article: Matsya Kingdom
Many historians have considered this region included in the Matsya Kingdom. Rigveda also provides certain evidences in this matter.[5][6] Manusmriti has called this land as 'Brahmrishi Desha'.[7]
Shekhawati region was included in 'Marukantar Desha' up to the Ramayana period. Out of 16 mahajanapadas prior to Buddha, only two Janapadas, namely Avanti and the Kingdom of Virata, were counted in the Rajasthan area. This region was also influenced by Avanti but later on Nandas of Magadha defeated Avanti. Historians believe that Mauryas obtained the Rajasthan from Nandas.[8]
In ancient times Shekhawati was not limited to the present two districts.  During the Mahabharata period, it was known as Matsya Kingdom and extended to the Sarasvati River. This was because the first clan ruling this region, in the Mahabharata period, were descendants of fishermen.[9] During ancient times this region was divided into several janapadas. Dhosi Hill, the revered hill bordering Haryana and famous for Chyavana Rishi's Ashram, as well as the place where Chyawanprash was formulated for the first time, has extensive mentions in the epic Mahabharat in Vanparv.
After the collapse of the Gupta dynasty, some parts of Shekhawati like Jhunjhunu, Fatehpur, and Narhar were controlled by the Kaimkhanis until they were defeated by Shekhawat Rajputs.
Kaimkhani is a branch emerging from the Chauhans. The first progenitor of Kaimkhanis was Karamchand, born in the family of Moterao of Chauhan clan, the ruler of Dadrewa. Firuz Shah Tughluq converted him to Islam and named him Kaimkhan. Thus his descendants are called Kaimkhani.

Shekhawat rule[edit]
  Bawdi in Fatehpur. Fatehpur was founded by Rao Fateh Singh of Sikar in 1515.
Shekhawati was established and ruled by Shekhawat Rajputs until India's independence.
Rao Shekha from Dhundhar established his own independent kingdom with the capital at Amarsar. He was the first independent ruler. After him, Rao Raimal, Rao Suja, and Rao Lunkaran become the rulers of Amarsar. Rao Manohar succeeded his father Rao Lunkaran and founded Manoharpur later renamed Shahpura (The present ruler of Shahpura is the Tikai of Shekhawat subclan). Shekhawats conquered the Jhunjhunu, Fatehpur, Narhar of Kaimkhanis and established their rule in 1445 and ruled till 1614.

Thikanas of Shekhawati[edit]

Geography[edit]
  Shekhawati region of Rajasthan (in blue)
Shekhawati is in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan and has special importance in the history of India. It also covers part of the Bagar tract along the Haryana-Rajasthan border.
The climate of the desert region is harsh and extreme. The temperature ranges from below 0 °C (32 °F) in winter to more than 50 °C (122 °F) in summer. The summer brings hot waves of air called loo. Annual rainfall is at around 450 to 600  mm. The groundwater is as deep as 200 feet (60 m), and in some places, the groundwater is hard and salty. The people in the region depend on rainwater harvesting. The harvested rainwater from the monsoon season (during July and August) is stored in pucca tanks and used throughout the year for drinking purposes.[13]

Architecture[edit]
Shahpura Haveli is a 300-year-old palace built by Rao Pratap Singh, descendant of Rao Shekha, in the 17th century. In the zenana (women's quarters), various rooms offer different themes. One room has antique murals, another has a marble fountain, while the turret room has walls that are 7 feet (2.1 m) thick. Diwankhana, the formal drawing room, is decorated with family portraits and an array of antique armour. The Haveli was then renovated by Maharaj Surendra Singh and is now running as a Heritage Hotel. The haveli was recognized as one of the Historic Hotels in the World in the year 2018.[14]

Havelis, temples and frescos[edit]
Most of the buildings of the Shekhawati region were constructed between the 18th century and the early 20th century. During the British occupation, traders adapted this style for their buildings.[15] Shahpura Haveli in Shahpura, 65 km from Jaipur on Jaipur - Delhi Highway, and Nangal Sirohi in Mahendragarh district, 130 km from Delhi, are popular for their Shekhawati architecture within the National Capital Region (NCR).[16]

Language: Shekhawati dialect[edit]
Shekhawati is a dialect of the Rajasthani language and is spoken by about three million speakers in the Churu, Jhunjhunu, and Sikar districts of Rajasthan. Even though it is a very important dialect from the grammatical and literary points of view, very little work is carried out on it. In 2001 a descriptive compendium of the grammar of Shekhawati was published.[17] Shekhawati, like the Bagri dialect of Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts, has a parallel lexicon which makes it very rich from a lexicographical point of view.[citation needed] Word order is typically SOV and there is the existence of implosives. The presence of high tone at the suprasegmental level classifies it with other dialects of Rajasthani. It has contributed significantly to the development of Rajasthani language and linguistics.
Some samples in Shekhawati are:

Kai Hoyo? कैं होयो?, 'What happened?'
The Kai kar rieya ho? थैं कैं कर रिह्या हो?, 'What are you doing?'
Ma Thane ghano samman desyu. मैं थांनै घणो सम्मान देस्यूं।, 'I will give you great respect.'
Thain sidh padhar rihya ho? थैं सिध पधार रिह्या हो?, 'Where are you going?'
Thain kein jeem rahiya ho? थैं कैं जीम रिह्या हो?, 'What are you eating?'
Agriculture[edit]
The Shekhawati region has the highest literacy in the state.[18] The predominant farming communities in the rural areas of Shekhawati are the Jats.

Education[edit]
Recently, the Shekhawati region has shown immense growth in the education sector and has become one of the most successful belt in terms of merit results. There are many schools and colleges that have been established, which is the prime reason of the huge success the region is seeing. Shekhawati is even used for name keeping of the Institutes[clarification needed]like Shekhawati Public School, Dundlod, Shekhawati Engineering college. There are many institutes named after Shekhawati.
