Operation Kingfisher is a part of government plans for Brexit. This programme will help companies over the transition period. A report published by the Times of London on 10 August detailed the programme to help large employers, particularly in the construction and manufacturing sectors because of their long supply chains. Fewer than 1,000 businesses are on the watchlist. The plan, which was conceived under Philip Hammond as a means to inject cash from the public purse directly into businesses, is currently being administered by Michael Gove.
