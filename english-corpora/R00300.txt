LOL, whose full original title is LOL: Last One Laughing, is an international comedy format through the Amazon Prime Video platform. It has been adapted in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Mexico, India, Brazil and Canada, plus an unlicensed adaptation in Iran. The concept was developed first in Japan, the original show is called "Hitoshi Matsumoto Presents Documental", also a Prime Original and has been aired in nine seasons since 2016.


== Rules ==
Ten comedians stay in a living-room style studio with hidden cameras for a few hours (usually six). During this time, they must try to make their opponents laugh in any way and by any means, while not reacting at their opponents attempts to make them break.
At the first laugh, the competitor is cautioned (yellow carded), while a second eliminates the player from the game (red carded). However, large infractions may be given an automatic red card. Eliminated players join the host in the observation room, but may return as an external challenger to the remaining contestants. The comedians can also be eliminated if they aren't active enough. The only way to communicate with the outside is a telephone controlled by the host.
