  Tiger in Sarisk Reserve
One of India's first national parks, it was formed primarily for the protection of tigers. Inside the park, there are two historical forts. One of them, situated near the Betla at 400 ft (120 m), was erected in the 16th century as the seat of Chero Kings. It is now deep inside the forest, but the main sentinel of the old fort is visible high up on the hill with defences in three directions and three main gates.
