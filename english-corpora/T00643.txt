  Location of Chandigarh
Chandigarh is India's first planned city, quite distinct from the rest of the country and considerably better organized. It is the capital of both Haryana and Punjab, but the city is not part of either state, being a union territory, i.e. administered directly by the central government.


Understand[edit]  Le Corbusier's Open HandThe most striking thing about the city is the expanse of resplendent blue sky with the mountains in the backdrop. When you approach the city, you see the jagged skyline of the Shivalik Hills looming large over the city and the faint image of an old temple dedicated to Goddess Chandi (15 km from Chandigarh) from which the city got its name.
Chandigarh may appear oddly familiar to Western visitors and idiosyncratic to the rest of India. Because of this, Chandigarh is a good place to visit if you need a break from the chaos of the rest of India. Chandigarh is also a very secure city. With the lowest crime rates in the country you can feel safe at any hour. Enjoy the planned city, with tree-lined roads, large beautiful roundabouts, several gardens and on top - a great set of people. Chandigarh and Mysore are considered the cleanest two cities of India.
History[edit]When India was partitioned, Punjab was split into two, with the western half going to Pakistan. Lahore, the historical capital of Punjab was also ceded to Pakistan, and Chandigarh was conceived of as a symbol of India's freedom, and a new beginning for Punjab.
The government of the state decided to build the new city at the foot of the Shivalik hills. Architects Albert Mayer and Mathew Novicki drew the initial plans in New York. When the latter died in an air crash in 1950, the work was entrusted to the French architect Edouard 'Le Corbusier' Jeanneret who created Chandigarh as a city of "Sun, Space and Verdure", to fulfill the basic functions of working, living, and care of body and spirit. Today, the city is home to more than 900,000 people living in harmonious conditions that are considered to be the best in the country.
  Le Corbusier's Secretariat BuildingOne can see architectural genius in the neat geometrical design of residential quarters, reinforced concrete structures and self-contained area layouts. Chandigarh is divided into 47 self-contained sectors. Each sector of the city is designed with its own shops, academic, and health care buildings, and places of worship, open spaces, greenery and residential areas. Chandigarh is one of the best planned cities of India. Roads are pretty wide and spacious. It hasn't grown in a haphazard way as some other Indian cities have.
The city is divided into four major work areas. In the north, the capital complex, consisting of the Secretariat, Legislative Assembly and High Court, with the hills as a background dominating the city. Sector 17, which is the city and district centre, houses the administrative and state government offices, as well as shopping malls, banks and other offices. The west contains the university, and institutions of engineering, architecture, Asian studies and medicine. The east zone is the industrial area of the city.
In 1966, Hindi-speaking areas of Punjab were split from the Punjabi speaking areas of the state to form a new state of Haryana. Chandigarh continued to be the capital of both states. This was supposed to be a temporary measure. The plan was that in 1986, the city would pass to Punjab. But this has been indefinitely delayed because Haryana insists on getting some territory in return, and the two states have not been able to agree on the area that should go to it.

On the whole, auto-rickshaws are quite popular in the city and are easily available at bus terminals, railway stations, and auto stands in the commercial market of every sector. It is very unlikely that they would operate with a meter so negotiate the price before engaging one.
By cycle rickshaw[edit][add listing]Cycle rickshaws are three-wheeled pedal powered rickshaws with seats in the back to seat passengers and a driver in the front. They are good for short distances, or places which are too far to walk but too short for taking a bus/taxi/auto rickshaw. Cycle rickshaws are now less prominent in the city but you can find one with a bit of luck. You should negotiate the price before boarding one of these.  Ask the locals to help if you doubt the charges demanded.














See[edit][add listing]  The Palace of Justice(Punjab and Haryana High Court)  Sports in The Open Hand's shadow  Pinjore Gardens  Statuettes at the Rock Garden  The Rose Garden  Sukhna Lake30.75884776.8044541 The Capitol Complex (Chandigarh Capitol Complex), Sector 1. Most of the capitol complex is fenced off due to tight security, the open hand is accessible and from there you can see the main buildings, albeit from a distance. If you want a closer look at the Capitol, you need permission from the Tourist Bureau, in the ‘Deluxe Administration building’ in Sector 9, or (which is much more convenient) to the new tourist office just nearby the high court. Please note the capitol and bureau are only open on M-F. The tourist bureau is not well signed, you’ll need to ask. It’s in the single story building out the back. Bring your passport and prepare for the beginning of the most amazing experience in Indian bureaucracy. The tourist bureau gives you three letters giving you permission to visit the three main buildings of the Capitol complex, The Secretariat, the High Court and the Assembly, but it may take hours for you to obtain the letters. It is one of 17 worldwide works by the architect Le Corbusier to be inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.   edit
30.7481976.786892 Chandigarh Museum (Government Architecture Museum), Sector 10. This provides an interesting aspect on how Chandigarh was founded. It begins with the principles on which Chandigarh was built, selection of the Architects, the design for the people etc. The correspondence between the Punjabi officials overseeing the construction of the city, and the Federal Government in Delhi is fascinating, and well worth taking a few minutes to read. Close by is the Government Museum and Art Gallery as well as the Museum of Science and Natural History Museum. edit
30.7053676.80113 Elante Mall. Elante Mall at Chandigarh is among the largest malls in North India, covering 20 acres.

In the entertainment section Elante Mall has PVR cinemas for entertaining large crowds.   (updated Mar 2015 | edit)
30.757376.80664 The High Court (Punjab and Haryana High Court also: Capitol High Court). The letter is fine for looking around the High Court; just show it to security at the entrance, around the back, but if you want to take photos you need to surrender your camera, and head in to fill out some more forms in the protocol office, and then take the forms back to security to get your camera back. It’s worth it as the building is amazing, and extremely photogenic. You can’t take any photos indoors.   (updated Mar 2015 | edit)
30.704476.784055 The Japanese Garden (Japani Garden). The Japanese Garden is a park in Sector 31 in union territory of Chandigarh. Built in 2014 in 13 acres of Land, by Indian Government, it was inaugurated by Shivraj Patil on 7th November 2014. It consists of water bodies, pagoda towers, water falls and golden bamboos. This is first ever garden in Chandigarh with Japanese touch and costs around ₹6 crore. (updated Mar 2015 | edit)
30.76102876.8032786 The Legislative Assembly (Palace of Assembly). This is the Assembly for both Punjab and Haryana. It's easy to run out of time, so make sure you have a whole clear weekday to appreciate all the capitol buildings.   (updated Mar 2015 | edit)
30.748976.787457 Museum and Art Gallery (Government Museum and Art Gallery) (Sector 10). The museum and the combined art gallery is an interesting place to go to. Artefacts range form Harappan period relics to paintings and coins from different areas and time periods. The Art Gallery has good collections of ancient and modern Indian art. Fossils of the local dinosaurs found in the region are on show in the adjacent natural history museum. The buildings that the Museums and Art Gallery are housed in are attractive.   (updated Mar 2015 | edit)
30.7933376.911698 Pinjore Gardens. Also called Yadavindra Gardens, these are 20 km (12 mi) from Chandigarh and 15 km (9 mi) from Panchkula, on the Chandigarh-Shimla road. Taxis and buses ply regularly between Pinjore and Chandigarh. Pinjore lies on the foothills of the lower Shivalik ranges. The fascinating gardens in the Mughal style are one of the most popular picnic spots in the region. A mini zoo, plant nursery, Japanese garden, historic palaces and picnic lawns await visitors.   (updated Mar 2015 | edit)
30.75285576.806519 Rock Garden of Chandigarh (Nek Chand's Rock Garden). In 1992, Nek Chand, a humble transport official, began to clear a little patch of jungle to make himself a small garden area. He set stones around the little clearing and before long had sculpted a few figures recycled from materials he found at hand. Gradually Nek Chand's creation developed and grew; before long it covered several acres and comprised hundreds of sculptures set in a series of interlinking courtyards. After his normal working day Chand worked at night, in total secrecy for fear of being discovered. When they did discover the garden, local government officials were thrown into turmoil. The creation was completely illegal - a development in a forbidden area. However, rather than demolishing the garden, they decided to give Nek Chand a salary so that he could concentrate full-time on his work, plus a workforce of fifty labourers. The park is open daily from April to September between 9AM-1PM and 3 to 7PM. Between October and March, it is open from 9AM-1PM and 2 to 6PM ₹30.   (updated Oct 2018 | edit)
30.74599176.78206410 Rose Garden (Zakir Hussain Rose Garden), Sector 16. The city houses the largest rose garden in Asia. It also hosts an annual rose festival which is quite popular among the local population.   edit
30.7612276.8005411 The Secretariat. You have to jump through some hoops to visit the Secretariat. First you need to find ‘Reception’, which is just a small building out the back, and show them your letter to get a visitor permit, then you need to see Security, who will let you in, then you need to see the main security officer inside, who will send you up to the Registrar, who will then send you back to the main security office. Thankfully you are escorted through most of this confusing, overly complex procedure, usually by a junior soldier with large machine gun. The whole process takes about 30 min to an hour. Once it’s all clear you can go up to the roof, check out the geranium gardens and take in an expansive view of all of Chandigarh. Then they’ll let you have a look out the front, which is more interesting.   (updated Mar 2015 | edit)
30.74232476.81871112 Sukhna Lake (Sector 1). Sukhna Lake is an artificial reservoir. A popular place to hang out, one can expect to find residents of the city jogging or strolling along the banks. There is a walking path, a cafeteria, shops and a mini-amusement park and paddleboats. Shikaras are also available. The Sukhna Lake was created in 1958 by damming the Sukhna Choe, a seasonal stream that flows down from the Shivaliks. Storks and cranes make migratory stops at the lake. The lake, incidentally, has Asia's longest water channel for rowing and yachting. Visiting Sukhna Lake in the evening or early morning is a particularly pleasant experience.   edit

It is recommended to go to a multi-screen cinema complex where the cinematic experience can be easily compared to any movie hall in the world.
The city has more than a dozen malls with 4 or 5 screen multiplexes.

"Spaghetti con Fungi [sic]", apart from the misspelling, is translated in the menu as "Black fungus [sic] in pesto cream sauce", which may put some off (unnecessarily). The buffet breakfasts (7AM-10:30AM; ₹675), lunches (12:30-3PM; ₹1,100), and dinners (7:30-11:30PM; ₹1,300-₹1,400) here are mostly geared towards the Indian palate and best avoided (the atmosphere, somewhat sterile in the best of times, also changes for the worse during these communal feeding periods). The WiFi comes at a premium here (₹140 for 30 minutes). edit

Bars and pubs[edit][add listing]Chandigarh is often accused of a dull nightlife for its status as a metro. Still, one can enjoy good drink at various pubs/bars with combined restaurants at Sector 35, Sector 26, and Sector 17. The bars remain open till midnight or 1AM.
'Condom Bar', a unique bar themed upon the condom, is operated by CITCO at Kalagram, Chandigarh-Manimajra road.

Sleep[edit][add listing]Budget[edit][add listing]Lodgings in central Chandigarh are notoriously overpriced, and the expense is generally not matched by quality improvements. Don't be surprised to be asked over ₹1000/night for a dingy room without windows in sector 22.
There is a number of budget housing options (of price and quality comparable to typical Indian cities) located in the large market area of sector 45. The area itself is considerably more "Indian" than the central districts, with its narrow winding streets and a strong community feel. As of February 2013, you should aim at ₹500/night in this area, after some haggling, and there are many hotels to choose from.

Connect[edit][add listing]The STD code for Chandigarh is 0172. When calling from overseas, dial +91 172 XXXXXXX. The same STD code is shared by Panchkula and Mohali. If you have a non-working phone number with only 6 digits, try adding a "2" in front of it.
Chandigarh has one of the highest cellular densities in India. The city is served by all major cellular operators : Airtel, Vodafone, Reliance, BSNL, Tata Indicom, Docomo, Virgin, Spice, and Connect. The cellular connection provided covers the cellular network of state of Punjab and city limits of Panchkula district in Haryana.
If you do not have an Indian phone number, it is strongly recommended that you get a pre-paid calling card if you plan on using your phone frequently. Because of new government regulations, you need a photocopy of your passport (visa and the ID pages), a colour photo, and proof of local address (in Chandigarh) when buying a pre-paid card.  Pre-paid cards are sold in a few of the shops that sell mobile equipment.
Due to the dramatic drop in the cost of cellular devices and SIM cards, the PCOs are rare and you will have to try hard to find one.
Internet is cheaply and easily accessible via various cyber cafes operating in every corner of the city with rates ranging from ₹15-₹30 per hour.
Major Cyber Outlets:
Reliance Web World: Operates through various centres in Sector 9, Sector 35, Sector 46, etc.
Sify Centres: Spread throughout the city.


Stay safe[edit]Chandigarh is a safe city. With the lowest crime rates in the country, you can feel safe at any hour. Police assistance can be found at the nearest police station or at the patrolling booths in every sector.
You can call following numbers for respective help : 100 (Police), 101 (Fire), 102 (Ambulance), 1073 (Traffic Police Helpline). If you are calling from a mobile phone, just add the STD code such as  0172 in front of the emergency numbers. This is true in any other Indian city.


Cope[edit]Balance[edit]India is often said to assault the senses, and can be overwhelming to travelers. Chandigarh may appear oddly familiar to Western visitors and idiosyncratic to the rest of India. Because of this, Chandigarh is a good place to visit if you need a break from the constant flow of India.
Hospitals[edit]List of major hospitals and health care centres:
Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd., Sector 34-A.
General Hospital Sector 16, Chandigarh
Government Medical College Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh
Mukat Hospital, Sector 34.

By all accounts the best multidisciplinary hospital complex in town (under the management of the central government of India, and conceived as the premier referral centre for all the northern states of India).  While it is not always good by Western standards, it has no rival this side of New Delhi.Pharmacies[edit]Pharmacies are a dime a dozen and you should not have any problem locating one, though Sector 16-C is considered the "pharmacy district" and offers a variety of shops to find your medication.  You do not need any prescription for Modern Medicine Over the Counter drugs and ayurvedic medicine (proprietary and traditional), which are available for most common ailments like fever, headache, travellers' ailments, general infection, etc., but you will need prescription for other medicines, which are categorized as Schedule H drugs.
You can locate 24-hour pharmacies at PGI and G.M.C.H., Sector 32.
General amenities[edit]General amenities for daily living like grocery shopping, laundry etc. can be availed all in one place in every sector's market complex. Each sector is self-sufficient in that regard and serves almost all the needs of its residents.
Traffic rules[edit]There is a strict enforcement of traffic rules in Chandigarh. Wearing helmets (for male riders ISI Marked), and using seat belts are compulsory. Violators pay heavy penalties. No exceptions to these rules are made to cars from outside the state.
Press[edit]The city has an expansive presence of leading national dailies which roll out their City-based editions. Among these are The Times of India, Hindustan Times, The Tribune, The Indian Express, Amar Ujala (Hindi), and Dainik Bhaskar (Hindi). The Tribune, one of the oldest print newspapers in circulation, has its headquarters in Chandigarh and is popular throughout the region.
