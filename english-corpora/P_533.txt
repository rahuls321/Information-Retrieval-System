SECTION CCXVII
Markandeya continued, 'O ornament of Kuru's race, he (Angiras) who was
the third son of Brahma had a wife of the name of Subha. Do thou hear of
the children he had by her. His son Vrihaspati, O king, was very famous,
large-hearted and of great bodily vigour. His genius and learning were
profound, and he had a great reputation as a counsellor. Bhanumati was
his first-born daughter. She was the most beautiful of all his children.
Angiras's second daughter was called Raga.[64] She was so named because
she was the object of all creature's love. Siniwali was the third
daughter of Angiras. Her body was of such slender make that she was
visible at one time and invisible at another; and for this reason she was
likened to Rudra's daughter. Archismati was his fourth daughter, she was
so named from her great refulgence. And his fifth daughter was called
Havishmati, so named from her accepting havis or oblations. The sixth
daughter of Angiras was called Mahismati the pious. O keen-witted being,
the seventh daughter of Angiras is known by the name of Mahamati, who is
always present at sacrifices of great splendour, and that worshipful
daughter of Angiras, whom they call unrivalled and without portion, and
about whom people utter the words kuhu kuhu wonder, is known by the name
of Kuhu.'
