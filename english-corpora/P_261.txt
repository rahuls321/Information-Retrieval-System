SECTION XXV
(Digvijaya Parva)
Vaisampayana said,--Arjuna, having obtained that best of bows and that
couple of inexhaustible quivers and that car and flag-staff, as also that
assembly-house, addressing Yudhisthira said,--Bow, weapons, great energy,
allies, territory, fame, army-those, O king, difficult of acquisition
however desirable, have all been obtained by me. I think, therefore, that
what should now be done is for the swelling up of our treasury. I desire,
O best of monarchs, to make the kings (of the earth) pay tributes to us.
I desire to set out, in an auspicious moment of a holy day of the moon
under a favourable constellation for the conquest of the direction that
is presided over by the Lord of treasures (viz. the North)."
Vaisampayana continued,--"King Yudhisthira the just, hearing these words
of Dhananjaya, replied unto him in a grave and collected tone, saying,--O
bull of the Bharata race, set thou out, having made holy Brahmanas utter
benedictions on thee, to plunge thy enemies in sorrow and to fill thy
friend with joy. Victory, O son of Pritha, will surely be thine, and thou
wilt surely obtain thy desires fulfilled.
"Thus addressed, Arjuna, surrounded by a large host, set out in that
celestial car of wonderful achievements he had obtained from Agni. And
Bhimasena also, and those bull among men, the twins, dismissed with
affection by Yudhishthira the just set out, each at the head of a large
army. And Arjuna, the son of the chastiser of Paka then brought under
subjugation that direction (the North) which was presided over by the
Lord of treasures. And Bhimasena overcome by force the East and Sahadeva
the South, and Nakula, O king, acquainted with all the weapons, conquered
the West. Thus while his brothers were so employed, the exalted king
Yudishthira the just stayed within Khandavaprastha in the enjoyment of
great affluence in the midst of friends and relatives."
"Bhagadatta, hearing this, said,--'O thou who hast Kunto for thy mother,
as thou art to me, so is Yudhishthira also. I shall do all this. Tell me,
what else I may do for thee."
