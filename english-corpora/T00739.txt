See[edit]
Watch towers generally have been constructed above the pools of water, so that in summer visitors may sit on these towers and easily see the animals that come to drink water. Artificial saltlicks have also been made for the animals. 
There is a tiger trap used by the Raja of Ramgarh to snare the animal. This spot is on the way to Rajderba, just a few kilometres ahead to the left.

Do[edit]
Put off all music and cut off all sound. Don’t frighten animals away. Leave the animals to themselves and just watch them from a distance. Also, put your vehicles light dim because too much may frighten the animals.
The towers are must see in hazaribagh forest. Tower no. 5 and 6 are not so far from the rest house.But 7 and 11 are a bit far. But tower no. 7 is a must see for nature lovers during sunset. It's like an adventure to go to tower 7 walking.

Buy[edit]
There is nothing to buy.

Eat[edit]
There is a small canteen inside the park. 

Drink[edit]
Carry whatever you want. No hard drinks are available. As a customary, it is advisable to carry an extra bottle or two of hard drink for the caretaker and the cook. You can get that extra bottle in the Hazaribag town at a reasonably cheap rate. They are away from the town and would welcome you with open arms. It is a tested mode.

Sleep[edit]
Carry your own stuff. Although bed is provided but due to the neglect of the Government, the accommodation is not very well maintained but the stay would be comfortable if you carry your own stuff.
