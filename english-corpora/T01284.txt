History[edit]
VKuchesar Fort was built in 1734 as an opium trading post, by the rulers of Kuchesar,[4] which belonged to the Dalal clan of the Jat people. In 1763 Afrasiab Khan, governor of nearby Koyal, took over the fort with a plot involving a royal eunuch spiking drinks with opium. The Jat rulers reclaimed the fort in 1782 and have held it ever since.[5] After the Pashtun Najib ad-Dawlah bestowed the Jat family with the title of Rao Bahadur, the fort served as the seat of the Jat Kingdom of Uttar Pradesh.[6] After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Jat people competed with Marathas, Rohillas, French colonists, traders, explorers, and the British East India Company for control of the area. In 1790, the fort was granted to Ajit Singh's family on a perpetual lease by Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II.[7] This grant was reaffirmed by the British in 1803.[8] Kuchesar Fort was also a Center for the Rai Brahmins or Bhatts (a branch of the Kashmiri Brahmins), who were the Rajkavi of Kuchesar State, performing a role similar to that of a poet laureate.
In 2007, the Kuchesar Fort was restored by Ajit Singh. The Kuchesar Fort is named Rao Raj Vilas Kuchesar Fort because Rao Raj Vilas is an older section structured in 1732 by Umrao Singh's Ancestor. Since 2007, the Rao Raj Vilas is a heritage hotel as the architecture consists of both Mughal and British.
