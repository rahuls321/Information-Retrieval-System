Mons (French pronunciation: ​[mɔ̃s]; Occitan: Monts or Mons) is a commune in the Var department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in southeastern France.


== Geography ==
Situated at an altitude of 814 metres the commune of Mons encompasses a vast territory of 80 km2 (31 sq mi) in the Var, Provence, ranging from 214 metres (at the confluent of the Siagne and the Siagnole rivers) to 1715 metres at the summit of Mont-Lachens. This explains the variety of different scenery found on the territory of the commune, as well as the diversity of its vegetation, but also accounts for the fact that it is sparsely cultivated. There are exceptional views from the village (from the Place Saint Sebastien), ranging from Menton to the East all the way to Toulon in the West.
