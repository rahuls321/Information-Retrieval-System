Rāma heard that highly sacred theme for many long days in the company of ascetics, kings and Vänaras. And understanding from the story that Kusa and Lava were Janaki's sons, Rāma mentioning her name said before the assembly:-Send a good emissary to the illustrious Vālmīki and let him communicate to the ascetics that if Janaki is sinless and has lead a pure life in the forest; let her give proof of purity by the great ascetic's permission. Let the emissaries learn well the intention of the ascetic in this and if Sītā is at heart willing to bring in proofs. To uphold her as well as mine purity, let Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, swear before the assembly in the morning of the next day. Hearing the words of Rānia, messengers went to Vālmīki and saluting the high-souled (ascetic) burning in his effulgence and of incomparable lustre, communicated to him, in sweet words all what Rāma had said. Hearing the words of the messengers and understanding Rama's intention the ascetic said. What Räma has said shall be satisfied. May good betide you. Husband is the greatest god for women. So SIta shall carry out his behests. The great ascetic having said this, the highly powerful emissaries, approaching Rāma, communicated to him what the Muni had said. Hearing the words of the high-souled Valmiki, Rama was greatly delighted. Having addressed the assembled Rșis and kings he said. The Rșis with their disciples, and the kings with their followers and all others willing shall see Sitā swear here. Hearing the words of the high-souled Rāma, all the high-souled Rșis began to speak of him in high terms and said. O foremost of men, such an action becomes you not any one else. There upon having settled that Sītă would swear next day, Rāma, the slayer of enemies, dismissed them all. And having made arrangements that Sītā would go through the trial next day, the highminded, generous king Rama bade adieu to all kings and Rşis.
