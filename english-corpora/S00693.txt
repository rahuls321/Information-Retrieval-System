Early life and education[edit]
McMurry-Heath was born and raised in Oakland, California.[1] Her mother was a public health nurse, and her father was a psychologist.[1]
After first pursuing a double major in art history and psychology during college, she changed her focus to biochemistry and received an undergraduate degree from Harvard University in biochemistry.[1] She is the first Black graduate of the Duke University combined MD / Ph.D. Medical Scientist Training Program, and completed her Ph.D. in immunology.[1][2]  

Career[edit]
After completing her education, McMurry-Heath worked in research for 12 years.[3] After training from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, she shifted to science policy, which included work from 2001 to 2004 as a legislative aide for Senator Joe Lieberman and drafting a  bioterrorism preparedness bill in 2002.[1][3][4] 
During her work with the Aspen Institute, she was a founding director of the Aspen Institute's Health, Biomedical Science, and Society Policy Program.[4] She also worked as an adjunct assistant professor of health policy at George Washington University.[4] In 2010, she became the associate director at the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the Food and Drug Administration.[1]  In this role, she developed partnerships with medical device nonprofits.[5] 
Towards the end of 2014, she became an executive at Johnson & Johnson and her management role later expanded.[1][6] While at Johnson & Johnson, she was advised by Michael D. Watkins, who continued as an advisor after she moved to her role as president and CEO of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO).[1]
In June 2020, McMurry-Heath became the chief executive of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), a lobbying organization that represents several hundred biotech companies,[1][7][8] including most of the companies that developed COVID-19 vaccines,[9] as well as academic institutions.[10] At BIO, she led the Coronavirus Collaboration Initiative, a group focused on developing COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.[11] In 2021, she was named as a possible nominee to lead the Food and Drug Administration.[12][13][14]
She has previously worked with the Council on Foreign Relations.[15] From 2018 to 2020, she was Chair of the NESTcc Governing Committee.[16] She is a member of the AAAS Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy (COSEPP).[17]
