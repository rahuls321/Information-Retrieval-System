In linear algebra, a complex square matrix U is unitary if its conjugate transpose U* is also its inverse, that is, ifwhere I is the identity matrix.In physics, especially in quantum mechanics, the conjugate transpose is referred to as the Hermitian adjoint of a matrix and is denoted by a dagger (†), so the equation above becomesThe real analogue of a unitary matrix is an orthogonal matrix. Unitary matrices have significant importance in quantum mechanics because they preserve norms, and thus, probability amplitudes. Properties For any unitary matrix U of finite size, the following hold:Given two complex vectors x and y, multiplication by U preserves their inner product; that is, ⟨Ux, Uy⟩ = ⟨x, y⟩.U is normal (                              U                      ∗                          U        =        U                  U                      ∗                                {\displaystyle U^{*}U=UU^{*}}  ).U is diagonalizable; that is, U is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix, as a consequence of the spectral theorem. Thus, U has a decomposition of the form                     U        =        V        D                  V                      ∗                          ,              {\displaystyle U=VDV^{*},}   where V is unitary, and D is diagonal and unitary.                              |                      det            (            U            )                    |                =        1              {\displaystyle \left|\det(U)\right|=1}  .Its eigenspaces are orthogonal.U can be written as U = eiH, where e indicates the matrix exponential, i is the imaginary unit, and H is a Hermitian matrix.For any nonnegative integer n, the set of all n × n unitary matrices with matrix multiplication forms a group, called the unitary group U(n).Any square matrix with unit Euclidean norm is the average of two unitary matrices. Equivalent conditions If U is a square, complex matrix, then the following conditions are equivalent:                    U              {\displaystyle U}   is unitary.                              U                      ∗                                {\displaystyle U^{*}}    is unitary.                    U              {\displaystyle U}   is invertible with                               U                      −            1                          =                  U                      ∗                                {\displaystyle U^{-1}=U^{*}}  .The columns of                     U              {\displaystyle U}   form an orthonormal basis of                                           C                                n                                {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}}   with respect to the usual inner product. In other words,                               U                      ∗                          U        =        I              {\displaystyle U^{*}U=I}  .The rows of                     U              {\displaystyle U}   form an orthonormal basis of                                           C                                n                                {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}}   with respect to the usual inner product. In other words,                     U                  U                      ∗                          =        I              {\displaystyle UU^{*}=I}  .                    U              {\displaystyle U}   is an isometry with respect to the usual norm. That is,                     ‖        U        x                  ‖                      2                          =        ‖        x                  ‖                      2                                {\displaystyle \|Ux\|_{2}=\|x\|_{2}}   for all                     x        ∈                              C                                n                                {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {C} ^{n}}  , where                     ‖        x                  ‖                      2                          =                                            ∑                              i                =                1                                            n                                                    |                                      x                              i                                                                    |                                            2                                                          {\textstyle \|x\|_{2}={\sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}|^{2}}}}  .                    U              {\displaystyle U}   is a normal matrix (equivalently, there is an orthonormal basis formed by eigenvectors of                     U              {\displaystyle U}  ) with eigenvalues lying on the unit circle. Elementary constructions = 2 × 2 unitary matrix =The general expression of a 2 × 2 unitary matrix iswhich depends on 4 real parameters (the phase of a, the phase of b, the relative magnitude between a and b, and the angle φ). The determinant of such a matrix isThe sub-group of those elements                     U              {\displaystyle U}   with                     det        (        U        )        =        1              {\displaystyle \det(U)=1}   is called the special unitary group SU(2).The matrix U can also be written in this alternative form:which, by introducing φ1 = ψ + Δ and φ2 = ψ − Δ, takes the following factorization:This expression highlights the relation between 2 × 2 unitary matrices and 2 × 2 orthogonal matrices of angle θ.Another factorization isMany other factorizations of a unitary matrix in basic matrices are possible.
