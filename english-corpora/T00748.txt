A variety of other birds is also seen nesting in the forest. 
In winter, the migrants take over and the pattern of bird life changes. The migrants include a variety of birds such as the blackbird, the blue-headed rock-thrush, the bluethroat, the red breasted flycatcher, the ashy minivet, the black headed cuckoo-shrike and a host of others.

Its command of the high road between Bhorghat and the rivers of Panvel and Apta, must have from the earliest time made Karnala a place of strategic importance. Two gateways — one at the foot and the other at the top of the rock-hewn steps — lead to a dual gateway with a chamber in between. There are two inscriptions in the fort, one in Marathi and the other in Persian. The fort has a chequered history of having passed through the hands of Muslim, Portuguese and Maratha rulers.
