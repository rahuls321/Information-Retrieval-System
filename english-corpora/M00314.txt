In mathematics, the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula, discovered by Emilie Virginia Haynsworth (1916–1985), concerns the number of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix and of block matrices into which it is partitioned.The inertia of a Hermitian matrix H is defined as the ordered triple                              I          n                (        H        )        =                  (                      π            (            H            )            ,            ν            (            H            )            ,            δ            (            H            )                    )                      {\displaystyle \mathrm {In} (H)=\left(\pi (H),\nu (H),\delta (H)\right)}  whose components are respectively the numbers of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of H.

However, a generalization has been proven in 1974 by Carlson, Haynsworth and Markham, to the effect that                      π        (        H        )        ≥        π        (                  H                      11                          )        +        π        (        H                  /                          H                      11                          )              {\displaystyle \pi (H)\geq \pi (H_{11})+\pi (H/H_{11})}   and                     ν        (        H        )        ≥        ν        (                  H                      11                          )        +        ν        (        H                  /                          H                      11                          )              {\displaystyle \nu (H)\geq \nu (H_{11})+\nu (H/H_{11})}  .Carlson, Haynsworth and Markham also gave sufficient and necessary conditions for equality to hold.
