Etymology[edit]
Word Chintamani refers to a precious stone or gem that's been documented since centuries in the Hindu Scriptures and Literature. However the naming of the town as 'Chintamani' doesn't have any relevance or relation with this gem. It's said that the town is named after a Maratha chieftain Chintamani Rao.

History[edit]
Before 19th Century[edit]
The Town of Chintamani along with the District of Kolar has been part of the continuous rule of numerous kingdoms and rulers that include Cholas, Vijayanagar Empire, Gangas, Mysore Wodeyars, Palegaras, Tippu Sultan, British and many local chieftains. This area during the 12th Century was under the rule of Kōpparakēsarivarman Vikrama Chola of the Chola dynasty.[2]
During the reign of British, the Town was called by name CHINTOMNIPETT. The document A Gazetteer of the Territories Under The Government of India on document page no. 204 reads...

.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}CHINTOMNIPETT. – A town in Mysore, distant N.E. from Bangalore 43 miles. Lat. 13° 23″, long. 78° 6″[3]
CHINTOMNIPETT in British accent could have been CHINTAMANIPETE (ಚಿಂತಾಮಣಿ ಪೇಟೆ), in local Indian accent.
However, as per the known history, the Maratha Chieftain Chintamani Rao was last in line to rule the locality of Chintamani. It's said that the Town has been named after the Chieftain.[4] Part from this nothing much is known either about this person or his achievements.
There are a few buildings and monuments available which stand as an evidence of the history of the place. There is no valid information available about these. Some of them include -
