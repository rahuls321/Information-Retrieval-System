Sariska Tiger Reserve is a national park in the Alwar district of the state of Rajasthan of India. In 1978, it was given the status of a tiger reserve making it a part of India's Project Tiger scheme.


Understand[edit]  Tiger bathingThe Sariska Tiger Reserve is one of the most famous national parks in India. Originally a hunting preserve of the erstwhile Alwar state, the area was declared a wildlife reserve in 1955. The present area of the park is 866 km². The park is situated 107 km from Jaipur and 200 km from Delhi.
History[edit]There is an ancient isolated fort in the forest reserve. This fort is said to be built by Aurangzeb to imprison his elder brother Dara Shekoh. The fort is called Kankarwari. The fort is not well maintained but the views are nice and provide breathtaking panoramic view of the valley. It is a steep climb to the top of a hill where the fort is built. 
There are the ruins of a temple complex where excavations are still occurring and one of the prominent temples is the 
Pandupol temple and not the Neelkantha temple, as some people mistake it to be. Legends say that at Pandupol Bhim was tested by Lord Hanuman for strength and humility. The ruins date back to a period between 6th and 13th century. The broken yet noble statues lying littered on the grounds tantalisingly tease and will not yield their secrets easily. It is a fascinating place for those that have a passion for romance with the past.
Flora and fauna[edit]  Spotted owlWildlife found in the Sariska Tiger Reserve includes the Bengal tiger, leopard, jungle cat, hyena, jackal, chital, sambar deer, caracal, langur, wild boar, four-horned deer (chowsingha), nilgay, monkeys and several species of birds. By 2004 the tigers had all disappeared, probably due to poaching. The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and state government of Rajasthan reintroduced tigers by relocating five of them from Ranthombor tiger reserve between 2008 and 2010.
Climate[edit]Best time to view the park is from November to March.
