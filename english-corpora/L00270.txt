A superpower is a fictional superhuman ability. Superpowers are most frequently used in science fiction comic books, television programs, video games, and films as the key attribute of a superhero. The concept originated in American comic books and pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s, and has gradually worked its way into other genres and media.[1]

Definition[edit]
There is no rigid definition of a "superpower." In popular culture, it is often associated with supernatural abilities such as flight, enhanced strength, invulnerability, or enhanced speed. However, it can also describe natural abilities that reach peak human potential, such as enhanced intelligence or weapon proficiency.[2][3][4]
Generally speaking, non-superhuman characters like Batman and Iron Man may be classified as superheroes even though they have no actual superhuman abilities beyond their exceptional talent and advanced technology. Similarly, characters with superhuman abilities derived from artificial, external sources, like Green Lantern's power ring and Tony Stark's Iron Man armor may be described as having superpowers, but are not necessarily superhuman.[5]
In fiction, superpowers are often given scientific, technological, pseudoscientific, or supernatural explanations. They come from sources such as magic, technology, or the character's own physiological nature (being an alien, a supernatural being, or a mutant).[2][5]

In manga and anime[edit]
Superpowers are a commonly used concept in manga and anime, particularly in the shonen genre. They are often featured in popular manga and anime such as Dragon Ball Z, Saint Seiya, YuYu Hakusho, One Piece, Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, Bleach, Code Geass, Fairy Tail, Hunter Ã— Hunter, Attack on Titan, and My Hero Academia.[6] 
The types of powers featured vary from series to series. Some, such as Dragon Ball and Fullmetal Alchemist, feature many different characters who have the same types of powers. Others, like One Piece and Bleach, feature characters with a wide range of different powers, with many powers being unique to only one or a few characters.[6]
