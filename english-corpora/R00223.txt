Pope John Paul II appointed Cullen as Bishop of the Diocese of Allentown on December 16, 1997, replacing the retiring Bishop Thomas Welsh. Cullen was installed on February 9, 1998. In 2003, he was appointed to the Board of Trustees of The Catholic University of America.In January 2004, Cullen stopped allowing the celebration of mass and other sacraments at The National Centre for Padre Pio in Barto, Pennsylvania, located in the Diocese of Allentown.  Cullen had previously expressed concern over the Centre's fundraising and lavish salaries for family members managing the Centre.  The Centre appealed Cullen's ruling to the Vatican, which rejected its appeal. In September 2020, Bishop Alfred A. Schlert lifted the sacrament ban on the Centre.  In 2008, Cullen carried out a restructuring of many parishes in the diocese. The diocese closed 47 parishes for a new total of 104 parishes. Some of the closed churches were then sold.

==== Handling of sexual abuse ====
On August 14, 2018, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro released a grand jury report on the handling of sexual abuse allegations against priests in Pennsylvania.  The report showed that Cullen, as Bishop of Allentown, instructed his vicar general Alfred Schlert to act as an "enabler" when handling abuse allegations. Shapiro said that Schlert and others earned promotions from Cullen for their work in handling the allegations. By the time the grand jury report was released, many records on sex abuse in the diocese were missing. The grand jury report involved six Pennsylvania dioceses, and it stated that "we believe that the real number — of children whose records were lost, or who were afraid ever to come forward — is in the thousands."
