History[edit]
Mythology[edit]
  Kaithal was known as Kapisthala during the Vedic period as seen in the map of the Indian subcontinent.
Historically the city was known as Kapisthal, meaning "Abode of Kapi", another name of Lord Hanuman, and it is said to have been founded by the Pandava Emperor, Yudhishthira of Mahabharata. The later word Kaithal is said to be derived from Kapisthala. It is traditionally connected with Hanuman and has a temple dedicated to Anjani, the mother of Hanuman. It is also said that it is the birthplace of Lord Hanuman and there is a temple constructed at that place known as "Anjani Tila" among the residents of Kaithal.[5]
The Vridhakedara (Vidkyar) sanctum of Kaithal finds a mention in the Vedic texts of Vaman Puran.[6] Kaithal, with many of its temples, is also an important milestone in the 48 Kos Parikrama pilgrimage.

Early and medieval history[edit]
Timur stopped here in 1398, before attacking Delhi. Later, the city became a Muslim cultural centre, under the rule of Delhi Sultanate. Tombs of several Sufi saints dating from the 13th century can be found in the city today; most important among them is that of Sheikh Salah-ud-din of Bhalkh (1246 CE). The town was renovated and a fort was built during the rule of the Mughal Emperor, Akbar, and as per Ain-i-Akbari, it was a pargana, under the sarkar of Sirhind, and had developed into an agricultural centre.[7]
Razia Sultana, the first woman ruler of India, reigned as the Sultana of Delhi Sultanate from 1236 to 1240. She fled Delhi with Malik Altúniya after they were defeated on the 24th of Rabí'u-l awwal A.H. 638 (Oct. 1240), and reached Kaithal the next day, where their remaining forces abandoned them, and were killed on 13 November 1240.[8][9][10] The tomb of Rajia Begam is still found here. This aspect is still not well known outside Kaithal, but residents know about the Mazaar of Razia Begum even generations later.
Timur took the town in 1398, with his army massacring or plundering the inhabitants and destroying all villages along the way to Assandh. Many of the residents of Kaithal and the other cities had fled to Delhi in fear.[11]

Modern history[edit]
In 1767, the city fell into the hands of the Singh Krora Misl chieftain, Bhai Desu Singh (d. 1781), who led a large Sikh force from his native village of Bhucho. In the Punjab whose descendants, the bhais of Kaithal, ranked among the most powerful Cis-Sutlej states. The Sikh Chieftains of Kaithal, ruled from 1767 until its fall in 1843. By 1808, it came under British influence. The state was ruled by the Scindhia dynasty of the Maratha Empire and paid tributes to the Marathas, until the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803–1805, after which the Marathas lost this territory to the British.[12][13][14] Bhai Udey Singh ruled over Kaithal and proved to be the last King. Bhai Udey Singh died on 14 March 1843. It became a municipality in 1867. In 1901, the town had a population of 14,408 and was the tehsil in the district of Karnal. The fort of the Bhais is still extant, and their title Bhai became common with the primary Jat Sikh rulers. Peoples of Kaithal took active part in the freedom struggle in 1857.[15][16][17]

Tomb of Razia Sultana[edit]
  Razia sultana tomb painting
The tomb of Razia Sultana, who gained the throne of Delhi Sultanate under the Mamluk Sultanate, is situated 10 km north-west of the Kaithal city in Siwan on  the Kaithal-Cheeka-Patiala road. It is close to the jail constructed nearby by the present administration. She and her husband Malik Altunia, who was the governor of Bhatinda (Punjab), were decapitated by the local Jat people of the area. It is speculated that she might have been disinterred from Kaithal and then reburied at her tomb in Delhi.
Raziya al-Din (1205  in Budaun  – 13 October 1240), throne name Jalâlat ud-Dîn Raziyâ, usually referred to in history as Razia Sultana, was the Sultan of Delhi in India from 1236 to May 1240. Like some other Muslim princesses of the time, she was trained to lead armies and administer kingdoms if necessary.[20] Razia Sultan was the only woman ruler of both the Sultanate and the Mughal period, although other women ruled from behind the scenes.[21] Razia refused to be addressed as Sultana because it meant "wife or consort of a Sultan". She would answer only to the title "Sultan."[22]

One of the highest flags of India[edit]

The Vridhakedara sanctum changed to "Vidkyara" as a result of the philological principle of "mukhasukha", or ease of speaking.[6] it is located near pehowa chowk,  the central point of Kaithal.

Islamic religious places[edit]
  Tomb of Sheikh Tayyab
Tomb of Sheikh Tayyab: The 16th-century tomb is situated in Kaithal city near Railway line. The words 'Sheikh' and Tayyab' stand for terms 'Fakir' (saint) and 'pure' Sufi saint Shah Kamal came to Kaithal from Bagdad. Sheikh Tayyab was a disciple and khalifa of Baba Shah Kamal. Sheikh Tayyab died sometime in the late 16th century AD. It is said that this tomb was constructed by Shah Sikandar,   Mazar of Shah Sikandar Qadri Kaithaly the grandson of Shah Kamal. The tomb is built on a square plan, a popular style of Pathan architecture. The roof is surmounted by a bulbous dome and a lotus flower finial rests on an octagonal drum-base.
Sheikh Tayyab's actual name was Lala Maidni Mal and he was one of the advisors to Mughal Emperor Akbar. He converted to Islam at the hands of Shah Kamal Qadri. His descendants from his Hindu wife are called "Qanugo" and the place where they used to live is called Mohalla "Qanugoyan" in Kaithal. There was a tradition when someone from Qanugo used to get married, they used to send one pitcher of sweet drink (sherbet) to sheikh Tayyab masjid (also known as masjid of mirrors) and one pitcher to Shah Kamal shrine.

  Mazar of Baba Shah Kamal Qadri Kaithaly
Tomb of Shah Kamal Qadri and Shah Sikandar Qadri (Baba Shah Kamal Lal Dayal):  known as Peer Baba to visitors, situated near Gol Market. Shah Kamal Qadri's shrine is well known in sub-continent for the past 450 years. He came from Baghdad in the time of Mughal emperor Akbar.[26]
Once there was famine in the times of Shah Kamal. When he came to know about it, he asked to prepare two big pots of special food (Dalya). One was prepared by a Muslim and the other one was prepared by a Hindu Brahman. It was announced that people from all over the city can come and eat day and night and take away this Dalya to their homes as well. There was a miracle that despite thousands of people eating from this langar, big pots were still filled with food. When famine ended, this food was also discontinued.
After that incident, it was a tradition that every year in the month of "sawan" rainy season, on all four Thursdays of rainy season, people of every religion used to get this special food "dalya" prepared and send it to the Dargah of Baba Shah Kamal to be distributed among the needful.
