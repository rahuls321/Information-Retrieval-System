SECTION LXXXIV
"'Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O Yudhishthira, the old account of a
conversation between Vrihaspati and Sakra is cited.'
"Sakra said, 'What is that one act, O regenerate one, by accomplishing
which with care, a person may become the object of regard with all
creatures and acquire great celebrity?'
"Vrihaspati said, 'Agreeableness of speech, O Sakra, is the one thing by
practising which a person may become an object of regard with all
creatures and acquire great celebrity. This is the one thing, O Sakra,
which gives happiness to all. By practising it, one may always obtain the
love of all creatures. The person who does not speak a word and whose
face is always furrowed with frowns, becomes an object of hatred with all
creatures. Abstention from agreeable speeches makes him so. That person
who, upon beholding others, addresses them first and does so with smiles
succeeds in making everyone gratified with him. Even gifts, if not made
with agreeable speeches, do not delight the recipients, like rice without
curry. If even the possessions of men, O Sakra, be taken away with sweet
speeches, such sweetness of behaviour succeeds in reconciling the robbed.
A king, therefore, that is desirous of even inflicting chastisement
should utter sweet words. Sweetness of speech never fails of its purpose,
while, at the same time it never pains any heart. A person of good acts
and good, agreeable, and sweet speeches, has no equal.'
"Bhishma continued, 'Thus addressed by his priest, Sakra began to act
according to those instructions. Do thou also, O son of Kunti, practise
this virtue."'
