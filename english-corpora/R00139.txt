== Early life ==
Borzello grew up in Tarzana. He is the godson of former Major League manager Joe Torre, who was friends with Borzello's father. His sister, Keri Borzello, was an NCAA Women's College World Series participant in 1994, as a catcher and first baseman for the Missouri Tigers.  She later transferred to UCLA after a career ending rotator cuff injury.
Early in his life, a then-12-year-old Borzello had been serving as a batboy for the Atlanta Braves - at that time, managed by Torre - and found himself in the middle of a series of brawls between the Braves and the visiting San Diego Padres on August 12, 1984 at Atlantaâ€“Fulton County Stadium. "When the fans started throwing stuff and jumped onto the field, I was like, 'OK, I gotta get out of here,' Borzello later said.
