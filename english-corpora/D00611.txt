Three antisocial personality traits: narcissism, machiavellianism, and psychopathy
  The Dark Triad, three antisocial personality traits: narcissism, machiavellianism, and psychopathy
In psychology, the dark triad comprises the personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.[1][2][3][4] They are called dark because of their malevolent qualities.[1][5][6][7]
Research on the dark triad is used in applied psychology, especially within the fields of law enforcement, clinical psychology, and business management.[citation needed] People scoring high on these traits are more likely to commit crimes, cause social distress, and create severe problems for organizations, especially if they are in leadership positions. [8]  They also tend to be less compassionate, agreeable, empathetic, satisfied with their lives, and less likely to believe they and others are good.[9]
All three dark triad traits are conceptually distinct although empirical evidence shows them to be overlapping. They are associated with a callous-manipulative interpersonal style.[10]

Narcissism is characterized by grandiosity, pride, egotism, and a lack of empathy.[11]
Machiavellianism is characterized by manipulation and exploitation of others, an absence of morality, unemotional callousness, and a higher level of self interest.[12]
Psychopathy is characterized by continuous antisocial behavior, impulsivity, selfishness, callous and unemotional traits (CU),[13] and remorselessness.[14]
A factor analysis found that among the big five personality traits, low agreeableness is the strongest correlate of the dark triad, while neuroticism and a lack of conscientiousness were associated with some of the dark triad members.[12] Agreeableness and the dark triad show correlated change over development.[15]

Components[edit]
The dark triad traits have significant theoretical and empirical overlap. All three traits share characteristics such as a lack of empathy,[16] interpersonal hostility,[17] and interpersonal offensiveness.[18] 
A number of measures have been developed to measure all three dark triad traits simultaneously, such as the Dirty Dozen[19] and the Short Dark Triad (SD3).[20] Most of these measures are questionnaire-style and either self-response or observer-response (e.g., ratings from supervisors or coworkers). Both methods can prove problematic when attempting to measure any socially-aversive trait. Self-responders may be motivated to lie,[21] and with observer responses - particularly for Machiavellianism - individuals who are skilled at deceiving and manipulating others should be perceived as low in deceptiveness and manipulation by others, resulting in inaccurate ratings.[21]
Despite these challenges and the acknowledged commonalities among the dark triad traits, there is evidence that the three traits are distinct.

Narcissism[edit]
Individuals who score high on narcissism display grandiosity, entitlement, dominance, and superiority.[22] Narcissism has been found to correlate positively with extraversion and openness and negatively with agreeableness.[1][23] Narcissism has also been found to have a significant correlation with psychopathy.[24]
Assessment of narcissism required clinical interviews until the popular Narcissistic Personality Inventory was created by Raskin and Hall in 1979.[25] Since the NPI, several other measures have emerged which attempt to provide self-report alternatives for personality disorder assessment.[26] In addition, new instruments have been developed to study pathological narcissism[27] as opposed to grandiose narcissism, which is what many argue the NPI measures.[28][29]

Machiavellianism[edit]
Named after the political philosophy of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, people who score high on this trait are excessively motivated by self-interest, cold, and lack morality.[clarification needed] They view interpersonal manipulation as the key for life success, and behave accordingly.[30] Individuals who are measured to have a high level of Machiavellianism tend to have low agreeableness and conscientiousness.[1][23] Machiavellianism is also correlated with psychopathy.[24]
The original published version of the Mach-IV is the most widely used measure in empirical research.[31][32]

Psychopathy[edit]
Considered the most malevolent of the dark triad,[33] individuals who score high on psychopathy show low levels of empathy and high levels of impulsivity and thrill-seeking.[34] With respect to the Big Five personality factors, psychopathy has been found to correlate negatively with agreeableness and conscientiousness.
[23]
Psychopathy was not formally studied until the 1970s with the pioneering efforts of Robert Hare, his Psychopathy Checklist (PCL), and its revision (PCL-R).[citation needed] Hare noted that asking psychopaths to self-report on psychologically important matters does not necessarily provide accurate or unbiased data.[35] However, efforts have been made to study psychopathy in the dimensional realm using self-reported instruments, as with the Levenson Primary and Secondary Psychopathy Scales,[36] The Psychopathic Personality Inventory,[37] and the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale.[38]

Dark core of personality[edit]
The dark core of personality or D-factor is the personality trait proposed to underlie all other dark personality traits.[39]

Other forms[edit]
Other groupings of dark personality traits have been proposed.

Dark tetrad[edit]
Several researchers have suggested expanding the dark triad to contain a fourth dark trait: sadism. It is defined as the enjoyment of cruelty, and is the most common addition.[40] While sadism is highly correlated with the dark triad, researchers have shown that sadism predicts anti-social behavior beyond the dark triad.[41][42] Sadism shares common characteristics with psychopathy and antisocial behavior (lack of empathy, readiness for emotional involvement, inflicting suffering), although Reidy et al. (2011)[43] showed that sadism distinctively predicted unprovoked aggression separate from psychopathy.[44]
Furthermore, sadism predicted delinquent behavior separately from the other dark triad traits when evaluating high school students.[44]
Harmful behavior against living creatures, brutal and destructive amoral dispositions, and criminal recidivism were additionally more prominently predicted by sadism than psychopathic traits.[44]
Studies on how sadists gain pleasure from cruelty to subjects were applied towards testing people who possessed dark triad traits. Results showed that only people exhibiting traits of sadism derived a sense of pleasure from acts of cruelty, concluding that sadism encompasses distinctly cruel traits not covered by the rest of the dark triad, therefore deserving of its position within the dark tetrad.[45]

Vulnerable dark triad[edit]
The vulnerable dark triad comprises three related and similar constructs: vulnerable narcissism, sociopathy, and borderline personality disorder. A study found that these three constructs are significantly related to one another and manifest similar nomological networks. Although the vulnerable dark triad members are related to negative emotionality and antagonistic interpersonal styles, they are also related to introversion and disinhibition; however these findings are based largely on the reports of parents of white undergrad students rather than information gleaned from clinical evaluation.[46]

Psychiatric disorders[edit]
In general, clinicians view narcissism and psychopathy as pathological.[citation needed] Given the dimensional model of narcissism and psychopathy, these traits are present at the subclinical level (where a person is close to meeting the criteria for diagnosis) in the general population; people with subclinical traits can be identified using self-report assessments that are appropriate for the general population.[47] In the general population, the prevalence rates for sub-clinical and clinical psychopathy are estimated at around 1% and 0.2%, respectively.[48][49][50]
Machiavellianism has never been referenced in any version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It has been treated as strictly a personality construct.

Behaviours[edit]
In the workplace[edit]

Oliver James identifies each of the three dark triadic personality traits as typically being prevalent in the workplace.[51] Furnham (2010) has identified that the dark triad is related to the acquisition of leadership positions and interpersonal influence.[30] In a meta-analysis of dark triad and workplace outcomes, Jonason and colleagues (2012) found that each of the dark triad traits were related to manipulation in the workplace, but each via unique mechanisms. Specifically, Machiavellianism was related with the use of excessive charm in manipulation, narcissism was related with the use of physical appearance, and psychopathy was related with physical threats.[52] Jonason and colleagues also found that the dark triad traits fully mediated the relationship between gender and workplace manipulation. The dark triad traits have also been found to be fairly well-represented in upper-level management and CEOs.[53]

Internet trolls[edit]
Recent studies have found that people who are identified as internet trolls tend to have dark personality traits and show signs of sadism, antisocial behavior, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism.[54][55][56] The 2013 case study suggested that there are a number of similarities between anti-social and flame trolling activities[citation needed] and the 2014 survey indicated that trolling is a manifestation of everyday sadism.[54] Both studies suggest that this trolling may be linked to bullying in both adolescents and adults.

Origins[edit]
Genetics and Environment[edit]
In a similar manner to research on the Big Five personality traits, twin studies have been conducted in an effort to understand the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors in the development of dark triad traits.
All three traits of the dark triad have been found to have substantial genetic components.[57] It has also been found that the observed relationships between the three traits, and with the Big Five, are strongly driven by individual differences in genes.[30] Within the triad, psychopathy and narcissism have both been found to be more inheritable than Machiavellianism.[30][24]
Environmental factors contribute to the development of dark triad traits, although they have less influence than genetics.[30] During childhood and adolescence, environmental factors that are not shared with siblings (such as friends or extracurricular activities) contribute to all three dark triad traits. However, only Machiavellianism is related to environmental factors that are shared with siblings.[58]
Some researchers have interpreted these findings to mean that, of the three, Machiavellianism is the trait most likely to be influenced by experience.[16]

Evolution[edit]
See also: Evolutionary psychiatry
Evolutionary theory may also explain the development of dark triad traits.[15] Despite the relationship of these traits with clinical disorders, some[Like whom?] argue that adaptive qualities may accompany the maladaptive ones; their frequency in the gene pool requires at least some local adaptation. The everyday versions of these traits appear in student and community samples, where even high levels can be observed among individuals who manage to get along in daily life. Even in these samples, research indicates correlations with aggression,[59] racism,[60] and bullying[41] among other forms of social aversiveness.
It has been argued that evolutionary behavior predicts not only the development of dark triad personalities, but also the flourishing of such personalities.[61] Indeed, it has been found that individuals demonstrating dark triad personality can be highly successful in society.[30] However, this success is typically short-lived.[30] The main evolutionary argument behind the dark triad traits emphasizes mating strategies.[62][63] This argument is based on life history theory, which proposes that individuals differ in reproductive strategies; an emphasis on mating is termed a "fast life" strategy, while an emphasis on parenting is termed a "slow reproductive" strategy.[64] There is some evidence that the dark triad traits are related to fast life history strategies;[65][66] however, there have been some mixed results, and not all three dark triad traits have been related to this strategy. A more detailed approach[67] has attempted to account for some of these mixed results by analyzing the traits at a finer level of detail. These researchers found that while some components of the dark triad are related to a fast life strategy, other components are related to slow reproductive strategies.[67]

Accelerated mating strategy[edit]
Studies have suggested that, on average, those who exhibit the dark triad of personality traits have an accelerated mating strategy, reporting more sex partners, more favorable attitudes towards casual sex,[68] lowered standards in their short-term mates,[69] a tendency to steal or poach mates from others,[70] more risk-taking in the form of substance abuse,[66] a tendency to prefer immediate but smaller amounts of money over delayed but larger amounts of money,[71] limited self-control and greater incidence of ADHD symptoms[65] and a pragmatic and game-playing romance style.[72] These traits have been identified as part of a fast life strategy that appears to be enacted by an exploitative, opportunistic, and protean approach to life in general[73] and at work.[52]
The evidence is mixed regarding the exact link between the dark triad and reproductive success. For example, there is a lack of empirical evidence for reproductive success in the case of psychopathy.[14] Additionally, these traits are not universally short-term-oriented[65] nor are they all impulsive.[16] Furthermore, much of the research reported pertaining to the dark triad cited in the above paragraph is based on statistical procedures that assume the dark triad is a single construct, in spite of genetic[24] and meta-analytic evidence to the contrary.[21]

Physical attractiveness[edit]
Several academic studies have found evidence that people with dark triad personalities are judged as slightly better-looking than average on first sight.[74] Two studies have determined that this is because people with dark triad traits put more effort into their appearance, and the difference in attractiveness disappears when "dressed down" with bland clothing and without make up.[75][76] Two more studies found that only narcissistic subjects were judged to be better-looking, but the other dark triad traits of Machiavellianism and psychopathy had no correlation with looks.[77][78] Facial features associated with dark triad traits tend to be rated as less attractive.[79]

Group differences[edit]
Gender[edit]
The most pronounced group difference is in gender: numerous studies have shown that men tend to score higher than women on narcissism,[80] Machiavellianism,[81][82][83] and psychopathy,[84][85][86][87] although the magnitude of the difference varies across traits, the measurement instruments, and the age of the participants. One interesting finding related to narcissism‚Äîalbeit one based on non-representative samples‚Äîis that while men continue to score higher than women, it seems that the gender gap has shrunk considerably when comparing cohort data from 1992 and 2006. More specifically, the aforementioned findings indicate that there has been a general increase in levels of narcissism over time among college students of both sexes, but comparatively, the average level of narcissism in women has increased more than the average level of narcissism in men.[80]

Race[edit]
There is far less information available on race differences in dark triad traits, and the data that is available is not representative of the population at-large. For instance, a 2008 research study using undergraduate participants found that Caucasians reported higher levels of narcissism relative to Asians.[88][89] Similarly, another 2008 study using undergraduate participants found that Caucasians tended to score slightly higher than non-Caucasians on Machiavellianism.[82] When attempting to discern whether there are ethnic differences in psychopathy, researchers have addressed the issue using different measurement instruments (e.g., the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale and The Psychopathic Personality Inventory), but no race differences have been found regardless of the measure used.[90][91] Additionally, when comparing Caucasians and African Americans from correctional, substance abuse, and psychiatric samples‚Äîgroups with typically high prevalence rates of psychopathy‚Äîresearchers again failed to find any meaningful group differences in psychopathy.[92] However, in controversial research conducted by Richard Lynn, a substantial racial difference in psychopathy was found. Lynn proposes "that there are racial and ethnic differences in psychopathic personality conceptualised as a continuously distributed trait, such that high values of the trait are present in blacks and Native Americans, intermediate values in Hispanics, lower values in whites and the lowest values in East Asians."[93] However this research has been heavily criticized for not distinguishing between psychopathy and other anti-social behaviors, confusing between personality and behavioral concepts of psychopathy and presuming rather than demonstrating genetic and/or evolutionary causes for supposed disparities.[94]

Generation[edit]
The focal variable when analyzing generational or cohort differences in dark triad traits has tended to be narcissism, arising from the hypothesis that so-called "Generation Me" or "Generation Entitlement" would exhibit higher levels of narcissism than previous generations.[citation needed] Indeed, based on analyses of responses to the Narcissistic Personality Inventory collected from over 16,000 U.S. undergraduate students between 1979 and 2006, it was concluded that average levels of narcissism had increased over time.[80] Similar results were obtained in a follow-up study that analyzed the changes within each college campus.[95]  However, a 2017 study found little evidence of strong or widespread cohort-linked changes in disposition or behavioral strategies, although they did find some indications that the current generation is more cynical and less trusting.[96]
An alternative perspective explored group differences in the dark triad and how they relate to positive emotion.[97] Applying Structural equation modeling and Latent Profile Analysis, a type of Mixture model, to establish patterns in UK, US, and Canadian students, four groups were found: ‚Äúunhappy but not narcissistic‚Äù, ‚Äúvulnerable narcissism‚Äù, ‚Äúhappy non-narcissism‚Äù and ‚Äúgrandiose narcissism‚Äù. Some extrapolations on how a person might deal with these groups of individuals in practice have been suggested.[98]

Relationship to other personality models[edit]
Big Five[edit]
The five factor model of personality has significant relationships with the dark triad combined and with each of the dark triad's traits. The dark triad overall is negatively related to both agreeableness and conscientiousness.[30] More specifically, Machiavellianism captures a suspicious versus trusting view of human nature which is also captured by the Trust sub-scale on the agreeableness trait.[99] Extraversion captures similar aspects of assertiveness, dominance, and self-importance as narcissism.[99] Narcissism also is positively related to the achievement striving and competence aspects of Conscientiousness. Psychopathy has the strongest correlations with low dutifulness and deliberation aspects of Conscientiousness.[30]

Honesty-humility[edit]
The honesty-humility factor from the HEXACO model of personality is used to measure sincerity, fairness, greed avoidance, and modesty. Honesty-Humility has been found to be strongly, negatively correlated to the dark triad traits.[100] Likewise, all three dark triad traits are strongly negatively correlated with Honesty-Humility.[30] The conceptual overlap of the three traits which represents a tendency to manipulate and exploit others for personal gain defines the negative pole of the honesty-humility factor.[101] Typically, any positive effects from the Dark Triad and low Honesty-Humility occur at the individual level, that is, any benefits are conferred onto the beholder of the traits (e.g., successful mating, obtainment of leadership positions) and not onto others or society at large. A study found that individuals who score low in Honesty-Humility have higher levels of self-reported creativity.[102]

Light triad[edit]
Influenced by the dark triad, Scott Barry Kaufman proposed a light triad of personality traits: humanism, Kantianism, and faith in humanity.[103][104][105] High scorers on humanism are more likely to value others' dignity and self worth. High scorers on Kantianism are more likely to see others as people, not as a means to an end. High scorers for faith in humanity are more likely to believe others are fundamentally good.[106][107][103] When comparing individuals who take both dark triad and light triad tests, the average person was more likely to exhibit light triad traits.[103] This test is not an inversion of dark triad tests, as Kaufman instead focused on developing characteristics that were conceptually opposite from the dark triad. A reliable measure of the light triad traits was developed, and demonstrated that they are not simply the opposite of the dark triad's Big Five and HEXACO model traits.[9] The light triad predicts positive and negative outcomes regarding Agreeableness and Honesty-Humility personality traits, and expands on understanding the dark triad as a useful contrasting analog.[9]

Individuals who score high on light triad traits also report higher levels of religiosity, spirituality, life satisfaction, acceptance of others, belief that they and others are good, compassion, empathy, self-esteem, authenticity, sense of self, positive enthusiasm, having a quiet ego, openness to experience and conscientiousness.[9] Additionally, those who score higher on the light triad scale are intellectually curious, secure in their attachments to others, and more tolerant to other perspectives.[106] These individuals typically have less motives for achievement and self-enhancement (even though the light triad was positively related to productivity and competence). In contrast to the character strengths of the dark triad, the light triad was uncorrelated with bravery or assertiveness. Lack of such characteristics may be problematic for individuals attempting to reach more challenging goals and fully self-actualizing.[108]  
Atlas of Personality, Emotion and Behaviour[edit]
The Atlas of Personality, Emotion and Behaviour[109] is a catalogue of 20,500 words descriptive of personality, emotion and behaviour. The words in the catalogue were scored according to a two dimensional matrix taxonomy with orthogonal dimensions of affiliation and dominance. Adjectives representing the behavioural patterns described by the Dark Triad were scored according to the atlas and visualised using kernel density plots in two dimensions.  The atlas clearly delineates the three components of the Dark Triad,  narcissism (green), Machiavellianism (blue), and psychopathy (red).

Emotional processes and capabilities[edit]
People with higher levels of dark triad traits (especially psychopathy) show emotional deficits in their knowledge about emotions and the way that they regulate their emotions.[110][111][112]
Two review papers examined the relationship between emotional intelligence and the dark triad,[112][110] finding that all three dark triad domains were related to lower emotional intelligence, with larger effects for psychopathy than for narcissism or Machiavellianism. Of the four emotional intelligence abilities (perceiving emotions, using emotions, understanding emotions and managing emotions), the largest effects were for managing emotions. The two different facets of narcissism showed different relationships with emotional intelligence. While vulnerable narcissism was linked with lower emotional intelligence, grandiose narcissism related to higher emotional intelligence. This may indicate that grandiose narcissism is an adaptive trait.
There is also evidence that dark triad traits relate to differences in how much people use two emotion regulation strategies: positive reappraisal (changing one's appraisals or thoughts about a situation to make the emotional impact more positive) and expressive suppression (suppressing the expression of emotion such as facial expression, vocal expression, or body language in order to reduce the emotional impact).[111] In a meta-analysis summarizing 20 different studies (83 effect sizes), primary psychopathy, secondary psychopathy and vulnerable narcissism related to greater use of expressive suppression and both primary and secondary psychopathy related to lower use of reappraisal. While Machiavellianism and grandiose narcissism were not significantly related to either reappraisal or suppression, there was less evidence available for these traits (such that there is absence of evidence rather than evidence of absence for these effects).

History[edit]
See also: History of narcissism and History of psychopathy
In 1998, McHoskey, Worzel, and Szyarto[113] provoked a controversy by claiming that narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy are more or less interchangeable in normal samples. Delroy L. Paulhus and McHoskey debated these perspectives at a subsequent American Psychological Association conference, inspiring a body of research that continues to grow in the published literature. Paulhus and Williams found enough behavioral, personality, and cognitive differences between the traits to suggest that they were distinct constructs; however, they concluded that further research was needed to elucidate how and why they overlap.[1]
