Keibul Lamjao National Park (Manipuri: Keibul Lamjao Leipaakki Lampaak) is the world's only floating national park. It is floating on the Loktak lake in the central bowl-like plain of Manipur in India. It is famous for being the home of the world's only dancing deer species, Brow antlered deer (Cervus eldi eldi) (Manipuri: Sangai). As the place is a major tourist attraction, the national park draws over thousands of visitors every month. 


Understand[edit]  Sangai deer (Cervus eldi eldi) illustrated in a stamp of IndiaKeibul Lamjao is one of the oldest national parks in India. It is the last and the only natural habitat for the world's only dancing deer species, Brow antlered deer (Cervus eldi edli) (Manipuri: Sangai).  
Many local villagers have been dispossessed of homes and land to allow park expansion. Some are for the reason of area encroachment. 
History[edit]Keibul Lamjao was first recognized as a wildlife sanctuary in 1966. The place was recognised as a national park in 1977.  
Landscape[edit]The greatest landmark in the park is the collection of floating islands formed by the vegetative masses  (Manipuri: Phumdi).  
Flora and fauna[edit]  A brow antlered deer inside the National ParkKeibul Lamjao hosts a rich and diversified population of floras and faunas in both aquatic as well as terrestrial habitats. 
Aquatic flora species include Zizania latifolia (wild rice, Manipuri: Ishing kambong), Tripidium bengalense, Eiranthus procerus (Manipuri: Singnang), Dioscorea bulbifera (Manipuri: Phumha), Cynodon dactylon (Manipuri: Tingthou), Alpinia galanga (Manipuri: Pullei), Eichhornia crassipes (Manipuri: Kabokang), Hedychium coronarium (Manipuri: Loklei), Nelumbo nucifera (Manipuri: Thambal) and Phragmites karka (Manipuri: Tou). In a 1960 study, the floating phumdi vegetation is composed of 45% Phragmites karka, 25% Erianthus ravennae (elephant grass), 15% Saccharum munja, 5% S. latifolium, 5% Alpinia allughas and 2% Saccharum procerum and 3% other species, including Zizania latifolia; Zizania latifolia is the plant much relished by the brow antlered deer (Manipuri: Sangai).  
Visitors could see the dancing deers (Manipuri: Sangai), frequently during early morning or during midday or late afternoon as the deers usually graze on the floating phumdis during these times. The Sangai deer is the main protagonist of the national park.

Under the water, there live several fishes including Channa striata, Channa punctatus, common carp, Wallago attu (Manipuri: Shareng) and pool barb.
