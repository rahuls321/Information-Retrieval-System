SECTION LXIX
"Dhritarashtra said, 'How hast thou, O Sanjaya, been able to know Madhava
as the Supreme Lord of the universe? And how is it that I am unable to
know Him as such? Tell me this, O Sanjaya.'
"Sanjaya said, 'Listen, O king! Thou hast no Knowledge, whereas my
Knowledge hath suffered no diminution. He that is without Knowledge and
is shrouded with the darkness of ignorance, knoweth not Kesava. Aided by
my knowledge, O sire, I know the slayer of Madhu to be the union of the
Gross, the subtle and the Cause; and that He is the Creator of all, but
is Himself increate; and also that, endued with Divinity, it is He from
whom everything springs and it is He unto whom all things return.'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'O son of Gavalgana, what is the nature of that
Faith which thou hast in Janardana and in consequence of which thou
knowest the slayer of Madhu to be the union of the Gross, the Subtle, and
the Cause?'
"Sanjaya said, 'Blessed be thou, O king, I have no regard for the
illusion (that is identified with worldly pleasures) and I never practise
the useless virtues (of vows and work without reliance on Him and purity
of Soul). Having obtained purity of Soul through Faith, I have known
Janardana from the scriptures.
"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Duryodhana, seek thou the protection of
Janardana, otherwise called Hrishikesa. O child, Sanjaya is one of our
trustiest friends. Seek refuge with Kesava.'
"Duryodhana said, 'If the divine son of Devaki united in friendship with
Arjuna, were to slay all mankind, I cannot, even then, resign myself to
Kesava.'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'This evil-minded son of thine, O Gandhari, is
resolved to sink in misery. Envious, wicked-souled, and vain, he setteth
aside the words of all his superiors.'
"Gandhari said, 'Thou covetous wretch that disregardest the commands of
the aged, abandoning thy father and myself and giving up prosperity and
life, enhancing the joy of thy foes, and afflicting me with deep
distress, thou wilt, O fool, remember thy father's words, when struck by
Bhimasena, thou wilt bite the dust.'
"Vyasa said, 'Listen to me, O king! Thou, O Dhritarashtra, art the
beloved of Krishna. When Sanjaya hath been thy envoy, he will verily lead
thee to thy good. He knoweth Hrishikesa,--that ancient and exalted One.
If thou listenest to him with attention, he will certainly save thee from
the great danger that hangs upon thee. O son of Vichitravirya, subject to
wrath and joy, men are entangled in various snares. They that are not
contented with their own possessions, deprived of sense as they are by
avarice and desire, they repeatedly become subject to Death in
consequence of their own acts, like blind men (falling into pits) when
led by the blind. The path that is trod by the wise is the only one (that
leadeth to Brahma). They that are superior, keeping that path of view,
overcome death and reach the goal by it.'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'Tell me, O Sanjaya, of that path without terrors by
which, obtaining Hrishikesa, salvation may be mine.'
"Sanjaya said, 'A man of uncontrolled mind can by no means know Janardana
whose soul is under perfect command. The performance of sacrifices
without controlling one's senses is even no means to that end.
Renunciation of the objects of our excited senses is due to spiritual
light; both spiritual light and abstention from injury arise doubtless
from true wisdom. Therefore, O king, resolve to subdue thy senses with
all possible vigour; let not thy intellect deviate from true knowledge;
and restrain thy heart from worldly temptations that surround it. Learned
Brahmanas describe this subjugation of the senses to be true wisdom; and
this wisdom is the path by which learned men proceed to their goal. O
king, Kesava is not obtainable by men who have not subdued their senses.
He that hath subdued his senses, desireth spiritual knowledge, awakened
by the knowledge of scriptures and the pleasure of Yaga-absorption.'
