Academic rank (also scientific rank) is the rank of a scientist or teacher in a college, high school, university or research establishment. The academic ranks indicate relative importance and power of individuals in academia.The academic ranks are specific for each country, there is no worldwide-unified ranking system. Among the common ranks are professor, associate professor (docent), assistant professor and instructor.In most cases, the academic rank is automatically attached to a person as soon as he/she is employed in a position with the same name, and deprived when a working relation is expired. Therefore the term "academic rank" usually means the same as "position in academia".However in some countries the terms "position" and "academic rank" are not synonyms. So in modern Russia there exist the docent and professor ranks, whereas the set of positions in academia is broader. The academic rank is conferred only after the person has been successfully working in the docent or professor position for a certain period (and later underwent a centralized control procedure), i.e. not at enrollment, and is kept for life.The list of academic ranks below identifies the hierarchical ranking structure found amongst scholars and personnel in academia. The lists below refer specifically to colleges and universities throughout the world, although other institutions of higher learning may follow a similar schema. Afghanistan Ranks in universities of Afghanistan are listed below according to the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) of Afghanistan. These ranks are issued stepwise by the MoHE after some procedures, a period of service and conditions.Lecturer or Assistant Professor (in Pashto پوهنیار)Senior Assistant Professor (in Pashto پوهنمل)Associate Professor (in Pashto پوهندوی)Senior Associate professor (in Pashto پوهنوال)Professor (in Pashto پوهاند)Honorary degree:Distinguished Professor (in Pashto لوی پوهاند)Term of address in general: ostād or استاد Argentina Tenured positions:Profesor Titular Ordinario, or Profesor Titular Regular. A tenured, full professor position.Profesor Asociado Ordinario, or Profesor Asociado Regular. A tenured, associate professor position.Profesor Adjunto Ordinario, or Profesor Adjunto Regular. A tenured, adjunct professor position. Australia Distinguished Professor, Emeritus Professor, and other professorships with highest honour and contributions to knowledge and society.Level E – Professor, or Professorial or Senior Principal Research Fellow; equivalent to Distinguished/Endowed Professor (USA) or Professor (UK).Level D – Associate Professor, or Principal Research Fellow if research intensive; equivalent to Reader/Associate Professor at a UK university.Level C – Senior Lecturer, or Senior Research Fellow if research intensive; equivalent to Senior/Principal Lecturer at a UK university.Level B – Lecturer, or Research Fellow if research intensive; Level B is the first tenured academic rank, normally requires at minimum, completion of a PhD.Level A - Associate Lecturer, or Associate Fellow if research intensive.There are often multiple bands or steps for each Level (e.g. Level B - 6 steps, Level C - 6 steps, Level D - 4 steps). For example, an academic who earns the title of Level D has progressed through 12 bands/steps of previous academic service or the equivalent in accumulated academic achievements. There is only one step for Level E. An academic cannot automatically progress from Level B, Step 6, to Level C, Step 1, without a formal application for promotion, which is typically a peer reviewed process. Bangladesh Teachers are categorized in four main classes in Bangladesh at the university level. The ascending ranks of teachers are Lecturer, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and Professor. University lecturers are normally required to hold a Master's degree. After obtaining a PhD, the appointment starts with assistant professor, then gradually associate professor and professor depending on research/teaching experience. Beside these, the title of emeritus is given to extraordinary professors after their retirement.Professor emeritusProfessorAssociate professorAssistant professorLecturerDemonstrator Belarus Academic ranksPrafiesar / Прафесар (Full professor)Dacent / Дацэнт (Associate professor)Starejšy vykladčyk / Старэйшы выкладчык (Senior lecturer)Asistent / Vykladčyk / Асістэнт / Выкладчык (Assistant professor / Lecturer)Researchers by seniority levelsHaloŭny navukovy supracoŭnik / Галоўны навуковы супрацоўнік (Chief Researcher)Viadučy navukovy supracoŭnik / Вядучы навуковы супрацоўнік (Leading Researcher)Starejšy navukovy supracoŭnik / Старэйшы навуковы супрацоўнік (Senior Researcher)Navukovy supracoŭnik / Навуковы супрацоўнік (Researcher)Malodšy navukovy supracoŭnik / Малодшы навуковы супрацоўнік (Junior Researcher)Administrative ranksRektar / Рэктар, rectorPrarektar / Прарэктар, vice-rectorDekan fakultetа / Дэкан факультэта, dean of the facultyNamiesnik dekana / Намеснік дэкана, vice-deanZahadčyk kafiedry / Загадчык кафедры, head of department Belgium Dutch speaking communityGewoon hoogleraar (distinguished professor, full-time) (professor ordinarius)Deeltijds gewoon hoogleraar - buitengewoon hoogleraar (part-time distinguished professor) (previously: professor extraordinarius)Hoogleraar (professor with personal chair, reader)Hoofddocent II (associate professor, principal lecturer)Hoofddocent I (associate professor, senior lecturer)Docent (assistant professor, lecturer)Doctor-assistent (researcher, must have a PhD)Assistent (research assistant, can be enrolled in a PhD or be in the postdoc phase)Aspirant (research fellow, enrolled in a PhD degree, appointed by the Fund for Scientific Research FWO)Administrative ranks:RectorVice-RectorDecaan (dean, i.e. head of a faculty)French speaking communityProfesseur ordinaire (full professor)Professeur extraordinaire (visiting professor in Switzerland, part-time professor in Belgium)Professeur (professor)Chargé de cours définitif (associate professor, tenured)Chargé de cours temporaire (associate professor, tenure-track)Chargé de cours invité (visiting assistant professor, non-tenured)Directeur de recherche (research director / senior research associate, appointed by National Fund for Scientific Research F.R.S.-FNRS)Chef de travaux agrégé (senior researcher, with Ph.D. and previously with teaching aggregation)Maître de recherche (senior researcher / senior research associate, with Ph.D., appointed by National Fund for Scientific Research F.R.S.-FNRS, tenured)Chef de travaux (senior researcher, with Ph.D.)Chercheur qualifié (senior researcher / research associate, with Ph.D., appointed by federal research council FNRS, tenured)Premier assistant (senior research assistant / junior lecturer, with Ph.D.)Maître d'enseignement (volunteer lecturer, unpaid, non-tenured)Maître de conférences (volunteer lecturer, unpaid, non-tenured)Chargé de recherche (appointed by National Fund for Scientific Research F.R.S.-FNRS)Assistant de recherche (research assistant)Aspirant (research fellow, enrolled in a Ph.D. degree, appointed by National Fund for Scientific Research F.R.S.-FNRS)Administrative ranks:Recteur (president of university)Vice-RecteurDoyen (dean, i.e. head of a faculty, elected)Président d'institut (director of research institute, elected)Vice-Doyen (vice-dean, i.e. head of studies in a faculty)Président de département (department head, elected) Bosnia and Herzegovina Asistent – teaching assistant (Must hold Undergraduate Degree with excellent grades.

However, there are no formal or legal academic ranks in Costa Rica.Each university decides their own names. For example in University of Costa Rica the highest rank is 'Profesor Catedrático' and it requires no more than a 5 year "licencitatura" degree and 15 years of teaching/researching and 16 publications (https://www.ucr.ac.cr/docencia/personal-docente.html). Most other universities have no similar framework and the title Professor is used unregulated by anyone.

The ascending rank of teacher is Demonstrator, Assistant Lecturer, Lecturer, Associate Professor and Professor. The initial position Demonstrator is generally enrolled as the top student of the class. Master's degree is required for university level Assistant Lecturer. After PhD, the appointment starts with Lecturer, then gradually Associate Professor and Professor depending on research/teaching experience. Beside these, professor of Emeritus is given to extraordinary professor after their retirement.OSTADH MOTAFAREGH (أستاذ متفرغ), equivalent to professor emeritus.OSTADH (أستاذ) (the "DH" pronounced like the "TH" in the word "THE"), equivalent to professor (usually after minimum of five years serving as OSTATH MOSAED as well as publishing certain number of research papers)OSTADH (the "DH" pronounced like the "TH" in the word "THE") MOSAED (أستاذ مساعد), equivalent to associate professor.MODARRES (مدرس), Lecturer (must have a PhD degree), equivalent to assistant professor.MODARRES MOSA'ED (مدرس مساعد), Assistant Lecturer (must have a master's degree)MOA'ED (معيد), or Teaching Assistant- also called demonstrator- (must have a bachelor's degree; usually graduated top of the class). Estonia Emeriitprofessor (Professor emeritus)ProfessorKaasprofessor (Associate professor)Lektor (Lecturer)Õpetaja (Teacher) Finland In Finland, there is less distinction between graduates and undergraduates: university students may be employed as research assistants (tutkimusapulainen) before they graduate with a master's degree. A person pursuing a doctoral degree must already hold a Master's degree, and is typically employed by the university, or enjoys a similar grant, and will be called väitöskirjatutkija (doctoral researcher), nuorempi tutkija (early career researcher), or tohtorikoulutettava (doctoral student). Besides post-doctoral researchers (tutkijatohtori) and senior teaching assistants (yliassistentti), there are several mid-level non-professorial positions, such as teaching researcher (opettava tutkija). Senior teachers and researchers may be employed as, e.g., erikoistutkija (special researcher) or yliopistotutkija (senior research fellow). Docent (dosentti) is a non-professorial rank and title (for life) awarded to academics qualified as a principal investigator and for supervision of doctoral students; however, they do not belong to the professor corps and may be employed elsewhere. Professors (professori) are understood as research group leaders and managers, and traditionally there is no direct equivalent of an assistant/associate/full professor career path, although Aalto University is introducing these. Qualifications for a professor's position are earned as a docent or in other mid-career positions. In management, professors serve as department heads (laitosjohtaja or osastonjohtaja) and deans (head of the faculty, dekaani). The leader of a university is called a rector (rehtori), assisted by multiple vice-rectors (vararehtori). Vice-rectors may retain their professor positions or work full-time as a vice-rector. Some universities have an even more senior officer called Chancellor (kansleri), who is more concerned with outreach and public relations than daily management. France In French business schools, ranks are the same as in the United States: Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and finally (Full) Professor.

In recent years it is moving towards the North American counterpart, with the titles renamed to their corresponding equivalence (professor (professor), associate professor (professor/reader), and assistant professor (senior-)lecturer)). Hong Kong's universities usually differ between professorial grades (end- or mid-career research and teaching positions) and lecturers (entry or mid-career positions - in the UK called either teaching fellows or lecturers, and "Mittelbau" in German-speaking countries). Depending on institutions, the title of "professor" is assumed by chair professors and professors, or assistant professors and above.Academic ranksChair professorEmeritus professorProfessorAssociate professorAssistant professorSenior LecturerLecturerAssistant LecturerResearch assistant professorPost-doctoral fellowAdjunct (associate/assistant) professorHonorary (associate/assistant) professorProfessional consultant or teaching consultant/fellowResearch associateResearch assistant and teaching assistant (or tutor, instructor, demonstrator)Postgraduate or graduateUndergraduateAdministrative ranksChancellor (titular, normally the Chief Executive (formerly the Governor) of Hong Kong) or president in the Hong Kong Shue Yan UniversityPro-chancellor (titular, only for the University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)Vice-chancellor or president (or vice president principal in the Hong Kong Shue Yan University): being the chief executive of the institutionDeputy vice-chancellor (as the first among pro-vice-chancellors in the University of Hong Kong)Pro-vice-chancellors or vice-presidents or deputy presidentsAssociate pro-vice-chancellors (as in the Chinese University of Hong Kong) or Associate vice-president (as in the Hong Kong Baptist University, the Lingnan University, the Hong Kong Shue Yan University, and the Hong Kong Institute of Education)RegistrarProvost (for some universities)Deans of faculties / schoolsHeads (or directors) of departments / schools Hungary Professzor/egyetemi tanár (university professor/full professor)főiskolai tanár (college professor)Docens (associate professor)Adjunktus (assistant professor)Tanársegéd (assistant lecturer) Iceland In Icelandic universities, especially The University of Iceland, prófessor is the most senior ranking teaching position. Below prófessor is dósent, then lektor. This three step hierarchy is akin to the US-scale, of full-, associate- and assistant-professors. Until the early 1990s no upward mobility was available in the Icelandic system. Most university teachers were hired as "prófessor." A "dósent" or a "lektor" wishing to ascend to a higher rank had to apply for a new position when it became available. Currently (since the 1990s) much more university teachers are hired as junior rank "lektor" and are promoted to "dósent" and "prófessor" if their work proves worthy of it.PrófessorDósent (associate-professors)Lektor (assistant-professors) India Regular Academic ranks (Hierarchy from top): Academic institutions in India have the mandate of teaching, training and research. This also includes research universities.ProfessorAssociate ProfessorAssistant ProfessorIn addition to these, there are government sponsored fellowships such as Ramanujan & Ramalingaswami. The fellowship is awarded to able candidates for a 5-year contract period during which they are hosted by an academic or research organisation. Their primary function is to carry out high quality original research. They may become a regular faculty as an assistant professor or associate professor during this period subject to their performance.Assistant Professor (on contract) / Ad hoc faculty – They are primarily involved in teaching for a limited contract period typically 6 months – 1 year.Research ranks (Hierarchy from top): Research institutions such as national labs have a different kind of hierarchy and are primarily concerned with basic and applied research. They guide Ph.D. students in their research thesis but do not grant degrees. In most cases the Ph.D. candidates are registered with another university which grants the degree. Awarding of degree is subjected to meeting the same criteria as Ph.D. guided by university professors.Scientist HScientist GScientist FScientist E (in some cases EII)Scientist D (in some cases EI)Scientist CScientist BNon-faculty ranksResearch associate (postdoctoral fellows/inspire faculty)Senior research fellow (Ph.D. students after completing two years of course work and research)Junior research fellow (Newly joined Ph.D. candidates)Administrative ranks in universitiesChancellorVice chancellorPro vice chancellorDeans / directorsChairmen / HODs / wardensAdministrative ranks in research institutionsDirector generalDirectorChairman of departments / divisions Indonesia Academic ranksAccording to the Joint Regulations of the Ministry of Education And Culture And Head of National Civil Service Agency No 4/VIII/PB/2014;  No 24 Year 2014 and the Regulation of Ministry of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform No. 46 Year 2013 and No. 17 Year 2013 Article 6; and the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education decree No. 164/ M/ KPT/ 2019, the academic ranks (Jabatan Fungsional) for lecturer (university-based) and researcher (non-university) areAcademic ranks for lecturersDosen (Lecturer)Asisten Ahli (Assistant Professor - Lower)Lektor (Assistant Professor - Upper)Lektor Kepala (Associate Professor)Guru Besar, Profesor (Professor)Academic ranks for researchersPeneliti Pertama (Junior Researcher)Peneliti Ahli Muda (Associate Researcher)Peneliti Ahli Madya (Senior Researcher)Peneliti Ahli Utama (Research Professor)Administrative ranks  (university)Rektor (Rector)Wakil Rektor (Vice Rector)Dekan (Dean)Wakil Dekan (Vice Dean)Kepala Program Studi (Head of Department) Iran Holders of bachelor's degree when granted to teach in a college:Assistant instructor (Persian: مربی آموزشیار; transliteration: "morabbi-e āmuzešyār")Holders of master's degrees when granted to teach in a college:Instructor (in Persian: مربی, transliteration: morabbi)Lecturer (in Persian: مدرس, transliteration: modarres)Holders of Ph.D. degrees:Assistant professor (in Persian: استادیار, transliteration: ostādyār)Associate professor (in Persian: دانشیار, transliteration: dānešyār)(Full) Professor (in Persian: استادتمام ,استاد, transliteration: ostād (tamām))Distinguished Professor (in Persian: استادِ ممتاز, transliteration: ostād-e momtāz'')Terms of address in general: ostādEmeritus ranksEmeritus professorFellowAdministrative ranksPresidentChancellorDeanHead of department.

Jamaica Professor EmeritusProfessorSenior Lecturer (Tenured)Lecturer (Tenured/Tenure track)Assistant LecturerInstructorTutorGraduate/Research Assistant Japan Tenured or non-tenured facultyThe ranking is as follows:Professor emeritus, Meiyo Kyōju (名誉教授)Professor, Kyōju (教授)Associate professor, Junkyōju (准教授) (previously, Jokyōju (助教授))Lecturer / Junior associate professor / Instructor / Assistant professor, Kōshi (講師)Assistant professor / Research Associate, Jokyō (助教) (previously, Joshu (助手))The Japanese system includes non-tenure, term-limited, tokunin (特任) positions at all ranks, including professor. These are referred to as ninki tsuki (任期付き) positions and officially include tokunin in the title. Limited tenure track positions (similar to the United States) have recently been introduced ("tenure". 国立研究開発法人 科学技術振興機構. Retrieved 15 June 2015.). In this system Jokyō (助教) corresponds to assistant professor. A major difference between the United States system and Japan is that granting of tenure and promotion to associate professor are not linked; one may be tenured yet remain an assistant professor.

The rank as professor is determined by the individual's institution while the SNI level is determined by an independent committee that evaluates the researchers nationwide.Many universities and research institutions make a distinction between "Profesores" -Professors- and "Investigadores" -Researchers- (Asociado A, B, C, Titular A, B, C), the main difference is that "Profesores" have a higher load of teaching, while "Investigadores" have a higher load of research, but normally all of them take part in both activities and are considered equivalent.Research rankings are awarded by the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores which depends on the national research council (Conacyt):SNI emeritus researcher (not necessarily higher rank but lifetime, requires 15 continuous years as SNI III)SNI III researcher (about 7% of the researchers in SNI)SNI II researcher (about 16% of the researchers in SNI)SNI I researcher (about 59% of researchers in SNI)SNI candidate researcher (C) (about 18% of researchers in SNI)All titles, both professors and researchers, can be given in a:Full-time, orPart-time basisAdministrative academic positions:RectorDirector of Faculty or CollegeCoordinator Morocco Academic Positions1.

The review requires a certain number 5/8/10 research publications (with at least 1/2/4 publications in the last 5 years) by the calendar years 2007/2008/2012 respectively, in HEC/PEC recognized journals.A professor requires ten years post-PhD teaching/research experience in an HEC recognized university or a post-graduate institution or professional experience in the relevant field in a national or international organization. It requires a minimum of 8/12/15 research publications (with at least 2/3/5 publications in the last 5 years) by the calendar years 2007/2008/2012 respectively,  in HEC/PEC recognized journalsProfessor EmeritusMeritorious Professor/ Distinguished National ProfessorProfessorAssociate professorAssistant professorLecturerLab EngineerResearch Associate Peru After some recent reforms in the University Law (Minedu, 2014), the Peruvian universities (publics and privates) consider these ranks:Extraordinary Professors: Principally, this is a category of recognition for his contribution as professor or researcher when he retires or as a professional when he has built a great contribution to society throughout his career. To have 10% as maximum of these professors in any university (public or private) is mandatory.Emeritus professor (Profesor Emérito) - For this recognition, the candidate should be faculty member (former ordinary professor in retiring process).Honorary professor (Profesor Honorario) - For this recognition, the candidate is not related to a faculty member. For instance, in this category is the Doctor Honoris Causa.Research Professors: Principally, full-time research position with few teaching responsibilities. Research professorships are almost always funded by grants or fellowships apart from the regular university budget. He is designated because of its academic excellence. He has a special bonus of fifty percent (50%) of its total payments. The competent authority of each university evaluates every two years, the production of the ordinary professors, for their permanence as a researcher.Ordinary Professors: Often full-time (with exclusivity) professors with research competences. Principal faculty. To have 25% as minimum of these professors in any university (public or private) is mandatory.Full professor (Profesor Principal) - PhD and MSc required, and former Associate professor or 15 years of experience (minimum) as researcher in the field to apply.Associate professor (Profesor Asociado) - PhD (postgraduate level) and MSc required, and former Assistant professor or 10 years of experience (minimum) as researcher in the field to apply.Assistant professor (Profesor Auxiliar) - PhD (postgraduate level) and MSc required, and 5 years of experience (minimum) as researcher in the field to apply.Lecturer (Hired Professors): Often part-time (with non-exclusivity) professors. Complementary faculty. Generally, the primary employer is not the university with which they have the status. Principally, this kind of professor come from practitioner market and not develop research activities. MSc required.In addition, the universities developed prior ranks, as junior temporary rank, to get experience and training (with strong motivation to be ordinary professor):Instructor (Instructor, Jefe de Práctica) - MSc required in Postgraduate level and BSc required in Undergraduate level.Teaching/Research Assistant (Asistente Académico/Investigador) - MSc required in Postgraduate level and BSc required in Undergraduate level.The lectures are usually hired by private universities as they can offer this type of part-time contract. The instructors are usually hired by public universities as their type of contract has to be full-time. Even if the duties of these two ranks are similar and the terminology for both is the same in Spanish: "Jefe de prácticas", we should consider the differences in their type of contract.
