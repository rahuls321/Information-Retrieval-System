John L. Campbell is a British YouTuber, retired nurse educator and author of nursing textbooks who has posted a number of widely-viewed YouTube videos on his Dr. John Campbell channel commenting on the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, Campbell's channel was referred to by UNICEF's regional office for Europe and Central Asia as good example of expert engagement with social media. By January 2022, his videos had been viewed more than 429 million times.
In November 2021, Campbell made false claims about the use of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment.[3] A few weeks later, another widely-viewed video of his was used by anti-vaccination activists to support the misinformation that COVID-19 vaccines cause widespread heart attacks, which he had not said.[4]

Early life and education[edit]
Campbell received a diploma in nursing from the University of London and Bachelor of Science in biology from the Open University. He subsequently earned a Master of Science in health science from the University of Lancaster and a Ph.D. in nursing education from the University of Bolton.[citation needed]

Career[edit]
Campbell worked as a nursing educator at the University of Cumbria, and has experience as an A&E nurse.[5] He has also taught health workers in India and Cambodia.[5] He is the author of Campbell's Physiology Notes and Campbell's Pathophysiology Notes nursing-related biosciences text books.  A 2011 book review in Emergency Nurse magazine said Campbell's Physiology Notes was "excellent, inexpensive notes on the causes, pathophysiological changes and clinical features seen in disease processes".[6]
In 2008, Campbell established a YouTube channel to provide educational lectures on topics in health science and nursing.[7] Until 2020, his videos received, on average, several thousand views each.[7] With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, however, his YouTube channel began to receive significant traffic, during which period he pivoted to focus on major issues related to the pandemic.[7] Between February and March 2020, his channel increased from an average of 500,000 views per month to 9.6 million, the plurality of which originated from the United States.[8] By September 2020, his videos had been viewed more than 50 million times.[9] Campbell has spoken of the importance of "a calm and measured approach that is as informed as possible"[10] and aims to assist people in making informed decisions about their health, giving a counterbalance to what he perceived were other persons on social media "spreading absolutely bonkers – and sometimes dangerous – information".[8]
In August 2020, UNICEF's regional office for Europe and Central Asia cited Campbell's Youtube channel as an excellent example of how experts might engage with social media to combat misinformation.[11]

COVID-19 misinformation[edit]

In November 2021, Campbell said in a video that ivermectin might have been responsible for a sudden decline in COVID-19 cases in Japan. However, the drug had never been officially authorised for such use in the country—its use was merely promoted by the chair of a non-governmental medical association in Tokyo, and it has no established benefit as a COVID-19 treatment.[3] Meaghan Kall, the lead epidemiologist for COVID-19 at the UK Health Security Agency, said that Campbell was confusing causation and correlation. Further, Kall said that there was no evidence of ivermectin being used in large numbers in Japan; rather, she said it "appears this was based on anecdata on social media driving wildly damaging misinformation".[3]
In November 2021, Campbell quoted from a non-peer-reviewed journal abstract by Steven Gundry saying that mRNA vaccines might cause heart problems.[4] Campbell's video was viewed over 2 million times within a few weeks and was used by anti-vaccination activists as support for the misinformation that COVID-19 vaccination will cause a wave of heart attacks.[4] According to a FactCheck review, Campbell had in his video drawn attention to typos in the abstract, and a lack of methodology and data, but he did not mention the expression of concern that had been published for the abstract, saying instead that it could be "incredibly significant".[4]
A popular misconception throughout the pandemic has been that deaths have been overreported.[12] In January 2022, Campbell posted a Youtube video in which he cited figures from the UK's Office of National Statistics (ONS) suggesting they showed deaths from COVID-19 were "much lower than mainstream media seems to have been intimating" and concentrated on a figure of 17,371 death certificates where only COVID-19 was given as a cause of death. Within a few days the video had been viewed over 1.5 million times.[13] A spokesman from the ONS clarified that death certificates mentioning COVID-19 anywhere meant that COVID-19 was a causal factor in the death. The official figure for COVID-19-related deaths in the UK for the period was over 175,000. Campbell's video was relayed by American comedian Jimmy Dore, who used it to claim that COVID-19 deaths had been overreported and that it proved the public had been the victim of a "scaremongering campaign".[12] Campbell's video was also promoted by British Conservative politician David Davis who called it "excellent" and said that it was "disentangling the statistics". The ONS subsequently responded saying "to suggest that [the 17,000] figure represents the real extent of deaths from the virus is both factually incorrect and highly misleading".[14]

Personal life[edit]
Campbell resides in Carlisle in the United Kingdom.[9] He has two children.[1]
