On October 3, 2019, Cynthia Erivo was cast to play Aretha Franklin.[46]

Filming[edit]
Principal photography for season one took place in mid-2016 in Prague.[27] Filming for season two began in November 2017 in Málaga and was expected to take place for over five months in various cities around the world, including Barcelona, Paris, and Budapest.[45][47] Filming for the third season was set to commence in November 2019, for an early-2020 release.[33][46] In March 2020, the production was shelved due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[48] The series resumed production on October 1, 2020.[49]

Music[edit]
Most of Franklin's music in season three was recorded by Erivo. The producers, however, were unable to obtain the rights to use Franklin's biggest songs, "Respect" and "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman".[50]

Reception[edit]
Critical reception[edit]
Season 1[edit]
The first season received mostly positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 83%, based on 29 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "Buoyed by a superb performance from Geoffrey Rush, Genius is a compelling origin story of one of history's most renowned scientists."[51] On Metacritic, the season had a score of 65 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[52]
Science columnist Dennis Overbye of The New York Times described the series as a "tense binge-worthy psychological thriller full of political and romantic melodrama."[53] Overbye further noted that Einstein himself, writing to his sister, wrote, "If everybody lived a life like mine, there would be no need for novels."[53] According to Hillary Busis of Vanity Fair, the film shows, "... Einstein at work ... peers into the über-genius's tumultuous love life (monogamy, he believes, is "not natural") ... his fraught emigration to the United States ...".[54] Busis quotes producer Ron Howard: "When you move past his scientific contributions, Albert's life story—what his youth was like, who his friends were, who his enemies were, his tumultuous love life—is a story people don't know ... I think audiences are going to be riveted as we tell this ambitious and revealing human story behind Einstein's scientific brilliance."[54]

Season 2[edit]
The second season received mixed reviews, but garnered praise for its star, Antonio Banderas. Rotten Tomatoes gave an approval rating of 59%, based on 17 reviews. Its critical consensus reads: "An impressive performance from Antonio Banderas rescues Genius: Picasso from condensed melodrama."[55] On Metacritic, the season had a score of 52 out of 100, based on 10 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".[56]

Season 3[edit]
The third season received mainly positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gave an approval rating of 73% based on 26 reviews. The critical consensus reads: "Cynthia Erivo captures the spirit of the singular singer with poise and passion - if only Aretha's writing were as strong as her performance."[57] On Metacritic, the season had a score of 67 out of 100, based on 10 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[58]

Reaction from Franklin's family[edit]
The family of Aretha Franklin did not react too kindly to the season. They claim they were not consulted in any part of the production, despite the crew's insistence that they worked with Franklin's estate.[59]
