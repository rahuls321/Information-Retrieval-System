In linear algebra, two n-by-n matrices A and B are called consimilar if                    A        =        S        B                                                            S                ¯                                                          −            1                                        {\displaystyle A=SB{\bar {S}}^{-1}\,}  for some invertible                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}   matrix                     S              {\displaystyle S}  , where                                                         S              ¯                                            {\displaystyle {\bar {S}}}   denotes the elementwise complex conjugation. So for real matrices similar by some real matrix                     S              {\displaystyle S}  , consimilarity is the same as matrix similarity. Like ordinary similarity, consimilarity is an equivalence relation on the set of                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}   matrices, and it is reasonable to ask what properties it preserves. The theory of ordinary similarity arises as a result of studying linear transformations referred to different bases. Consimilarity arises as a result of studying antilinear transformations referred to different bases. A matrix is consimilar to itself, its complex conjugate, its transpose and its adjoint matrix.  Every matrix is consimilar to a real matrix and to a Hermitian matrix.  There is a standard form for the consimilarity class, analogous to the Jordan normal form.
