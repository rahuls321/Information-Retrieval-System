Hearing Rāma's words, Bharata answered, Deprived of the kingdom in consequence of my posteriority in point of birth, what does regard for morality avail me? O best of men, even this morality has ever been established with reference to us, viz., that the eldest son of the king existing, a younger one cannot be the king. Do you, therefore, O Rāghava go along with me to the prosperous Ayodhya; and get yourself ir stalled there for the behoof of our race. Although a king observing interest and virtue, and who towers above average humanity, has been called a mortal, yet to me he is a very deity. While I was in Kekaya and you was in the forest that intelligent monarch honoured of the good, given to celebrating sacrifices, ascended heaven. As soon as you had set out (for the forest) along with Sītā and Lakşmaņa, the king borne down by grief and chagrin, went to heaven. O foremost of men, do you arise, and offer water to the spirit of our sire. Śatrughna and I have ere this offered water to (the departed). O Rāghava, anything offered to the (manes of the) ancestors by a beloved descendant, conduces to their eternal behoof; and you the favourite of our father. Mourning you and exceedingly desirous of seeing you, his mind being fastened on you and incapable of being turned away, deprived of you, and smitten with grief of your account, your father departed this life, remembering you. was
