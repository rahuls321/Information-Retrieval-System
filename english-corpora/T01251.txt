Legend[edit]
  Image of the fort structure
According to Hindu legend, the hillock on which the fort is located was carried by Hanuman, a disciple of Sri Ram from the epic Ramayana. The hillock is known as Namagiri and also as Saligramam, the image of Vishnu in a divine stone. Hanuman was flying with the Sanjeevi Paravatha, the sacred mountain from Himalayan mountain to Sri Lanka. On his way, he saw the Kamalalayam tank and descended there to perform his morning worship. He placed the saligramam he brought from Himalayas and when he opened his eyes after the worship, he saw the stone grown to its current size. A divine voice asked him to leave the stone in the place itself. As per another legend, Narasimha, an avatar of Vishnu, after destroying Asura Hiranyakasipu, was still in ferocious mood. Hanuman, brought him to the place where Mahalakshmi, the wife of Vishnu was doing penance.[2]

There is a Narasimha Murthy temple and a mosque that are located within the fort, both of which are popular tourist attractions of the town.[4] Kamalalayam tank, located at foothills, is commonly associated with the fort.[5] The fort is made up with well-cut blocks of the same stone as the hill and cemented to the rock by mortar.
