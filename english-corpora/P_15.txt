(Astika Parva continued)
"Sauti said, 'That Brahmana of rigid vows then wandered over the earth
for a wife but a wife found he not. One day he went into the forest, and
recollecting the words of his ancestors, he thrice prayed in a faint
voice for a bride. Thereupon Vasuki rose and offered his sister for the
Rishi's acceptance. But the Brahmana hesitated to accept her, thinking
her not to be of the same name with himself. The high-souled Jaratkaru
thought within himself, 'I will take none for wife who is not of the same
name with myself.' Then that Rishi of great wisdom and austere penances
asked him, saying, 'Tell me truly what is the name of this thy sister, O
snake.'
"Vasuki replied, 'O Jaratkaru, this my younger sister is called
Jaratkaru. Given away by me, accept this slender-waisted damsel for thy
spouse. O best of Brahmanas, for thee I reserved her. Therefore, take
her.' Saying this, he offered his beautiful sister to Jaratkaru who then
espoused her with ordained rites.'"
