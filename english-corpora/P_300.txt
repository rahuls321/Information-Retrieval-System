SECTION LXIV
"Sakuni said,--'Thou hast, O Yudhishthira, lost much wealth of the
Pandavas. If thou hast still anything that thou hast not yet lost to us,
O son of Kunti, tell us what it is!"
"Yudhishthira said,--O son of Suvala, I know that I have untold wealth.
But why is it, O Sakuni, that thou askest me of my wealth? Let tens of
thousands and millions and millions and tens of millions and hundreds of
millions and tens of billions and hundreds of billions and trillions and
tens of trillions and hundreds of trillions and tens of quadrillions and
hundreds of quadrillions and even more wealth be staked by thee. I have
as much. With that wealth, O king, I will play with thee."
Vaisampayana said,--"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting
unfair means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo, I have won!'
'Yudhishthira said,--'I have, O son of Suvala, immeasurable kine and
horses and milch cows with calves and goats and sheep in the country
extending from the Parnasa to the eastern bank of the Sindu. With this
wealth, O king, I will play with thee.
Vaisampayana said,--"Hearing this Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting
unfair means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo, I have won!'
Yudhishthira said,--'I have my city, the country, land, the wealth of all
dwelling therein except of the Brahmanas, and all those persons
themselves except Brahmanas still remaining to me. With this wealth, O
king, I will play with thee.'
Vaisampayana said,--"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting
foul means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo! I have won.'
"Yudhishthira said,--These princes here, O king, who look resplendent in
their ornaments and their ear-rings and Nishkas and all the royal
ornaments on their persons are now my wealth. With this wealth, O king, I
play with thee.
Vaisampayana said,--"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with his dice, adopting
foul means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo! I have won them.'
"Yudhishthira said,--'This Nakula here, of mighty arms and leonine neck,
of red eyes and endued with youth, is now my one stake. Know that he is
my wealth.'
Sakuni said,--'O king Yudhishthira, prince Nakula is dear to thee. He is
already under our subjection. With whom (as stake) wilt thou now play?"
Vaisampayana said,--"Saying this, Sakuni cast those dice, and said unto
Yudhishthira, 'Lo! He hath been won by us.'
Yudhishthira said,--"This Sahadeva administereth justice. He hath also
acquired a reputation for learning in this world. However undeserving he
may be to be staked in play, with him as stake I will play, with such a
dear object as it, indeed, he were not so!"
Vaisampayana said,--"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting
foul means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo! I have won.'
"Sakuni continued,--'O king, the sons of Madri, dear unto thee, have both
been won by me. It would seem, however, that Bhimasena and Dhananjaya are
regarded very much by thee.'
"Yudhishthira said,--'Wretch! thou actest sinfully in thus seeking to
create disunion amongst us who are all of one heart, disregarding
morality.'
"Sakuni said,--'One that is intoxicated falleth into a pit (hell) and
stayeth there deprived of the power of motion. Thou art, O king, senior
to us in age, and possessed of the highest accomplishments. O bull of the
Bharata race, I (beg my pardon and) bow to thee. Thou knowest, O
Yudhishthira, that gamesters, while excited with play, utter such ravings
that they never indulge in the like of them in their waking moments nor
even in dream.'
"Yudhishthira said,--He that taketh us like a boat to the other shore of
the sea of battle, he that is ever victorious over foes, the prince who
is endued with great activity, he who is the one hero in this world, (is
here). With that Falguna as stake, however, undeserving of being made so,
I will now play with thee.'"
Vaisampayana said,--"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting
foul means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo! I have won.'
"Sakuni continued,--'This foremost of all wielders of the bow, this son
of Pandu capable of using both his hands with equal activity hath now
been won by me. O play now with the wealth that is still left unto thee,
even with Bhima thy dear brother, as thy stake, O son of Pandu.
"Yudhishthira said,--'O king, however, undeserving he may be of being
made a stake, I will now play with thee by staking Bhimasena, that prince
who is our leader, who is the foremost in fight,--even like the wielder
of the thunder-bolt--the one enemy of the Danavas,--the high-souled one
with leonine neck and arched eye-brows and eyes looking askance, who is
incapable of putting up with an insult, who hath no equal in might in the
world, who is the foremost of all wielders of the mace, and who grindeth
all foes,'"
"Vaisampayana said,--"Hearing this, Sakuni, ready with the dice adopting
foul means, said unto Yudhishthira. 'Lo! I have won.'
Sakuni continued,--Thou hast, O son of Kunti, lost much wealth, horses
and elephants and thy brothers as well. Say, if thou hast anything which
thou hast not lost.'
Yudhishthira, said--'I alone, the eldest of all my brothers and dear unto
them, am still unwon. Won by thee, I will do what he that is won will
have to do.'"
Vaisampayana said,--"Hearing this Sakuni, ready with the dice, adopting
foul means, said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo! I have won.'
'Sakuni continued,--'Thou hast permitted thyself to be won. This is very
sinful. There is wealth still left to thee, O king. Therefore, thy having
lost thyself is certainly sinful.'"
Vaisampayana continued,--"Having said this, Sakuni, well-skilled at dice,
spoke unto all the brave kings present there of his having won, one after
another, all the Pandavas. The son of Suvala then, addressing
Yudhishthira said,--'O king, there is still one stake dear to thee that
is still unwon. Stake thou Krishna, the princess of Panchala. By her, win
thyself back.'
"Yudhishthira said,--'With Draupadi as stake, who is neither short nor
tall, neither spare nor corpulent, and who is possessed of blue curly
locks, I will now play with thee. Possessed of eyes like the leaves of
the autumn lotus, and fragrant also as the autumn lotus, equal in beauty
unto her (Lakshmi) who delighteth in autumn lotuses, and unto Sree
herself in symmetry and every grace she is such a woman as a man may
desire for wife in respect of softness of heart, and wealth of beauty and
of virtues. Possessed of every accomplishment and compassionate and
sweet-speeched, she is such a woman as a man may desire for wife in
respect of her fitness for the acquisition of virtue and pleasure and
wealth. Retiring to bed last and waking up first, she looketh after all
down to the cowherds and the shepherds. Her face too, when covered with
sweat, looketh as the lotus or the jasmine. Of slender waist like that of
the wasp, of long flowing locks, of red lips, and body without down, is
the princess of Panchala. O king, making the slender-waisted Draupadi,
who is even such as my stake, I will play with thee, O son of Suvala.'"
Vaisampayana continued,--'When the intelligent king Yudhishthira the just
has spoken thus,--'Fie!' 'Fie!' were the words that were uttered by all
the aged persons that were in the assembly. And the whole conclave was
agitated, and the kings who were present there all gave way to grief. And
Bhishma and Drona and Kripa were covered with perspiration. And Vidura
holding his head between his hands sat like one that had lost his reason.
He sat with face downwards giving way to his reflections and sighing like
a snake. But Dhritarashtra glad, at heart, asked repeatedly, 'Hath the
stake been won?' 'Hath the stake been won?' and could not conceal his
emotions. Karna with Dussassana and others laughed aloud, while tears
began to flow from the eyes of all other present in the assembly. And the
son of Suvala, proud of success and flurried with excitement and
repeating. Thou hast one stake, dear to thee, etc. said,--'Lo! I have
won' and took up the dice that had been cast."
