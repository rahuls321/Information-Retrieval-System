Unknown

  Peru

Lina Medina, from the Ticrapo District of Peru, gave birth by cesarean section in Lima at age .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}5+1⁄2. The infant was a 2.69 kg (5.9 lb), 47.5 cm (18.7 in) boy named Gerardo. Medina's parents, who thought their daughter had a tumor, took her to a hospital, where she was then found to be 7 months pregnant when she was about 5 years and 6 months old. She gave birth 1+1⁄2 months later. By interrogating her parents, the doctors understood that Medina had entered into precocious puberty (when hormone glands are activated earlier than normal) very early after her birth.[1][2][3][4][5] Medina's father was arrested on suspicion of sexual abuse, but was later released due to lack of evidence, and the baby's biological father was never identified.[1][4]

H.

 6 years,7 months

Unknown

  British India (now  India)

The 6-year-old known only as "H." gave birth by cesarean section to a girl weighing 4.19 lb (1.90 kg) at Victoria Zanana Hospital in Delhi, India. She was initially admitted for what was thought to be an abdominal tumor, as she complained of localized pain in her lower abdomen. Her father said she was 7, but civic records gave her birth date as October 11, 1925, making her 6 years and 7 months old at the time of labor. She had never menstruated and her breasts were still far from being fully developed, yet she was able to breastfeed her child for 9 months.[6]

"Liza" Yelizaveta Pantueva [uk](Ukrainian: Єлизавета Пантуева)(Russian: Елизавета (Лиза) Пантуева)

 6 years

Her 70-year-old maternal grandfather

  Soviet Union Ukrainian SSR  (now  Ukraine)

Yelizaveta Pantueva (Liza) was 5 years old when her 70-year-old maternal grandfather raped and impregnated her. She had her 6th birthday several days before giving birth. Pantueva's parents did not want the obstetricians to perform a cesarean section, as it was considered dangerous at the time. She gave birth in Kharkiv, with the aid of forceps and retractors. The 3 kg (6.6 lb), 52 cm (20 in) infant girl died during labor due to an early placental tear; she had been born at full term and apparently of good constitution and, according to doctors, would have survived if she had been extracted more quickly, revived, and oxygenated. After the incident, the family emigrated to the Soviet Far East, taking the girl's grandfather with them, and were never heard from again.[7]
