Prevalence of English-based programming languages[edit]

The use of the English language in the inspiration for the choice of elements, in particular for keywords in computer programming languages and code libraries, represents a significant trend in the history of language design. According to the HOPL online database of languages,[1] out of the 8,500+ programming languages recorded, roughly 2,400 of them were developed in the United States, 600 in the United Kingdom, 160 in Canada, and 75 in Australia.
Thus, over a third of all programming languages have been developed in countries where English is the primary language. This does not take into account the usage share of each programming language, situations where a language was developed in a non-English-speaking country but used English to appeal to an international audience (see the case of Python from the Netherlands, Ruby from Japan, and Lua from Brazil), and situations where it was based on another programming language which used English.

International programming languages[edit]
The concept of international style programming languages was inspired by the work of British computer scientists Christopher Strachey, Peter Landin, and others. It represents a class of languages of which the line of the algorithmic languages ALGOL was exemplary.

ALGOL 68[edit]
ALGOL 68's standard document was published in numerous natural languages. The standard allowed the internationalization of the programming language. On December 20, 1968, the "Final Report" (MR 101) was adopted by the Working Group, then subsequently approved by the General Assembly of UNESCO's IFIP for publication. Translations of the standard were made for Russian, German, French, Bulgarian, and then later Japanese. The standard was also available in Braille. ALGOL 68 went on to become the GOST/ÐÐÐ¡Ð¢-27974-88 standard in the Soviet Union.

GOST 27974-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 â Ð¯Ð·ÑÐº Ð¿ÑÐ¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð¼Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ñ ÐÐÐÐÐ 68[2]
GOST 27975-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 extended â Ð¯Ð·ÑÐº Ð¿ÑÐ¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð¼Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ñ ÐÐÐÐÐ 68 ÑÐ°ÑÑÐ¸ÑÐµÐ½Ð½ÑÐ¹[3]
In English, Algol68's case statement reads case ~ in ~ out ~ esac. In Russian, this reads Ð²ÑÐ± ~ Ð² ~ Ð»Ð¸Ð±Ð¾ ~ Ð±ÑÐ².

Citrine[edit]
Localization is the core feature of the Citrine Programming Language. In Citrine, every human language has its own version, for instance the West Frisian language version is called Citrine/FY. Citrine features localized keywords, localized numbers and localized punctuation. Users can translate code files from one language into another using a string-based approach. At the time of writing, Citrine supports 111 human languages. Support is not limited to well-known languages; all natural human languages are being accepted for inclusion, up to EGIDS-6.

Scheme[edit]
While Internationalization is not a part of any Scheme standard, the expressiveness and flexibility of the language allows for the addition of internationalization as a library.  International Scheme is an open source project to which anyone can contribute a translation.  Since translations of Scheme can be loaded as libraries, Scheme programs can be multilingual.

Languages based on symbols instead of keywords[edit]
APL â A language based on mathematical notation and abstractions.
Brainfuck â A minimalist esoteric programming language, created for the purpose of having the smallest possible compiler.[20]
G â Graphical language used in LabVIEW (not to be confused with G-code).
Hoon â A systems programming language for Urbit, compiling to Nock.
J â An APL-like language which uses only ASCII special characters and adds function-level programming.
Light Pattern - A language which uses a series of photographs rather than text as source code.[21]
Mouse â A minimalist language created by Dr. Peter Grogono which uses ASCII characters for keywords.
Piet â An art-based esoteric programming language.
PlankalkÃ¼l â The first high-level non-von Neumann programming language, designed by Konrad Zuse during World War II in Germany.
Whitespace â An esoteric language based on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and line breaks).
Modifiable parser syntax[edit]
Babylscript â A multilingual version of JavaScript which uses multiple tokenizers to support localized keywords in different languages and which allows objects and functions to have different names in different languages.
Component Pascal â A preprocessor that translates native-language keywords into English in an educational version of the BlackBox Component Builder available as open source.[58] The translation is controlled via a modifiable vocabulary and supported by modifiable compiler error messages. A complete Russian version is used in education, and it should be possible to accommodate other left-to-right languages (e.g., the Kabardian language has been tried as a proof of concept).
HyperTalk â A programming language, which allows translation via custom resources, used in Apple's HyperCard.
IronPerunis â An IronPython 2.7 localization to Lithuanian and Russian.
AppleScript â A language which once allowed for different "dialects"[22] including French and Japanese; however, these were removed in later versions.
Maude â Completely user-definable syntax and semantics, within the bounds of the ASCII character set.[23]
Perl â While Perl's keywords and function names are generally in English, it allows modification of its parser to modify the input language, such as in Damian Conway's Lingua::Romana::Perligata module, which allows programs to be written in Latin or his Lingua::tlhInganHol::yIghun Perl language in Klingon. They do not just change the keywords but also the grammar to match the language.
Perunis â Python 2.6 localization to Lithuanian and Russian.
Ioke â Ioke is a folding language. It allows writing highly expressive code that writes code. Examples of same program in Chinese, Danish, Hindi and Spanish
