There have also been stories of residents waking up and finding small shadowy forms standing beside the bed but disappearing right away. The mother of the 3 children was found dead at the bottom of the bannister a month before their death but it was ruled an accident since there was never any proof of evidence otherwise. The stepfather hanged himself in his cell so the case never made it to the justice system.
The Bell Witch was a poltergeist said to haunt the family of John Bell near the town of Adams, Tennessee starting in 1817. The spirit was said to have been witnessed by Andrew Jackson although this is highly unlikely and has manifested itself as various animals and a disembodied voice mocking John and citing scripture from the Bible. It was also said to have tormented the family violently but seemed to have a fondness for daughter Betsy as she grew older until she fell in love with a man the witch despised. Eventually the ghost was blamed for John Bell's death after it was said it left a poison disguised as medicine. The Bell Witch partly inspired The Blair Witch Project and the events of her story were depicted in the film An American Haunting.
