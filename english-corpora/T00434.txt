Kohima (/koʊˈhiːmə/ pronunciation (help·info)) (Angami Naga: Kewhi-ra), is the capital city of India's north eastern state of Nagaland. With a resident population of almost 100,000, it is the second largest city in the state.[1] Originally known as Kewhira, Kohima was founded in 1878 when the British Empire established its headquarters of the then Naga Hills District of Assam Province. It officially became the capital after the state of Nagaland was inaugurated in 1963. Kohima was the site of one of the bloodiest battles of World War II. The battle is often referred to as the ‘Stalingrad of the East’.[2][3] In 2013, the British National Army Museum voted the Battle of Kohima to be ‘Britain's Greatest Battle’.[4]
Kohima constitutes both a district and a municipality. The municipality covers 20 km2 (7.7 sq mi). Kohima lies on the foothills of Japfü range located south of the District (25°40′N 94°07′E﻿ / ﻿25.67°N 94.12°E﻿ / 25.67; 94.12)[5] and has an average elevation of 1,261 metres (4137 feet).[6]

Etymology[edit]
Kohima was originally known as Kewhi–ra.[7] The name, Kohima, was officially given by the British as they could not pronounce the Angami name of Kewhi–ra (Tenyidie for "the land where the flower ‘Kewhi’ grows"). It is called after the wild flowering plant ‘Kewhi’, found in the mountains. Most local people prefer to use ‘Kewhi–ra’.

History[edit]
Kohima was originally a large village named Kewhira, which is located in the northeastern part of the present day Kohima Urban Area. The village is divided into four large clans (thinuo): Tsütuonuomia, Lhisemia, Dapfhütsumia and Pfüchatsumia (T, L, D, and P Khel respectively).

Colonial era[edit]
The East India Company Administration started to expand into Kohima beginning the 1840s.[8] The progress made by the company armies in annexing the region continued after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, although now under the auspices of the British Indian Army. Kohima was the first seat of modern administration as the Headquarters of Naga Hills District (then under Assam Province) with the appointment of Guybon Henry Damant as Political Officer in 1879.

Battle of Kohima[edit]
Main articles: Battle of Kohima and Battle of the Tennis Court
  The mined tennis court and terraces of the District Commissioner's bungalow in Kohima.
In 1944 during the Second World War the Battle of Kohima along with the simultaneous Battle of Imphal was the turning point in the Burma Campaign.[9] For the first time in South-East Asia, the Japanese lost the initiative to the Allies, which the Allies then retained until the end of the war. This hand-to-hand battle and slaughter prevented the Japanese Army from gaining a base from which they might have easily gone into the plains of India.[10]

  Kohima War Cemetery, Kohima, Nagaland
Kohima has a large cemetery known as the War Cemetery in Kohima for the Allied war dead; it is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The cemetery lies on the slopes of Garrison Hill, in what was once the Deputy Commissioner's tennis court, which was the scene of intense fighting known as the Battle of the Tennis Court. The epitaph carved on the memorial of the 2nd British Division in the cemetery has become world-famous as the Kohima poem.


When You Go Home, Tell Them Of Us And Say,
For Your Tomorrow, We Gave Our Today.


The verse is attributed to John Maxwell Edmonds (1875–1958), and is thought to have been inspired by the epitaph written by Simonides to honour the Greek who fell at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.[11]

1963–present[edit]
When Nagaland became a full-fledged state on 1 December 1963, Kohima was christened as the state capital.[12]
On 20 March 1986, two students Kekuojalie Sachü and Vikhozo Yhoshü were killed in indiscriminate firing by Nagaland Police when they participated in a peaceful protest called by the Naga Students' Federation (NSF) to rally against the state government's decision on the introduction of Indian Police Service (IPS) cadres and the extension of the Disturbed Area Belt from 5 to 20 km along the Indo-Myanmar (Indo-Burma) border. The event was so tumultuous that it led three Cabinet ministers and five state ministers of Nagaland to resign.[13]
On March 5, 1995, when a convoy of the 16th Rashtriya Rifles of the Indian Army was traversing through Kohima, a tyre burst from one of the convoy's own vehicle led the armed troops to mistake the sound of the tyre bursting for a bomb attack. The troops reacted immediately and started firing at civilian populace. A total of 7 were killed and 36 were left injured. The incident is widely referred to as the 1995 Kohima Massacre.[14][15]

Geography[edit]
Topography[edit]
Kohima lies north of the Japfü Barail intersection with Pulie Badze to the southwest overlooking the city.[16]

Climate[edit]
The city experiences a subtropical highland climate (Köppen: Cwb), with greater contrast between summer and winter than in other continents due to the monsoons but mild temperatures even for latitude and altitude. The months of June to September concentrate much of the precipitation.[17]
Kohima has pleasant winters with little rainfall and very warm, very rainy summers. The coolest months are from December to February, when frost may occur and in the highest altitudes occasional snowfall is possible. During the height of summers, from June to August, temperatures range on average from 18–27 °C (65–80 °F), with heavy and frequent rainfall.[citation needed]
