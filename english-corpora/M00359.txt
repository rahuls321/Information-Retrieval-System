In the mathematical fields of linear algebra and functional analysis, the orthogonal complement of a subspace W of a vector space V equipped with a bilinear form B is the set W⊥ of all vectors in V that are orthogonal to every vector in W.  Informally, it is called the perp, short for perpendicular complement.  It is a subspace of V. Example Let                     V        =        (                              R                                5                          ,        ⟨        ⋅        ,        ⋅        ⟩        )              {\displaystyle V=(\mathbb {R} ^{5},\langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle )}   be the vector space equipped with the usual dot product                     ⟨        ⋅        ,        ⋅        ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle }   (thus making it an inner product space), and let                     W        =        {        u        ∈        V        :        A        x        =        u        ,                 x        ∈                              R                                2                          }              {\displaystyle W=\{u\in V:Ax=u,\ x\in \mathbb {R} ^{2}\}}  , with                    A        =                  (                                                                      1                                                  0                                                                              0                                                  1                                                                              2                                                  6                                                                              3                                                  9                                                                              5                                                  3                                                              )                .              {\displaystyle A=\left({\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&1\\2&6\\3&9\\5&3\\\end{array}}\right).}  then its orthogonal complement                               W                      ⊥                          =        {        v        ∈        V        :        ⟨        u        ,        v        ⟩        =        0        ,                 ∀        u        ∈        W        }              {\displaystyle W^{\perp }=\{v\in V:\langle u,v\rangle =0,\ \forall u\in W\}}   can also be defined as                               W                      ⊥                          =        {        v        ∈        V        :                                            A              ~                                      y        =        v        ,                 y        ∈                              R                                3                          }              {\displaystyle W^{\perp }=\{v\in V:{\tilde {A}}y=v,\ y\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}\}}  , being                                                        A              ~                                      =                  (                                                                      −                  2                                                  −                  3                                                  −                  5                                                                              −                  6                                                  −                  9                                                  −                  3                                                                              1                                                  0                                                  0                                                                              0                                                  1                                                  0                                                                              0                                                  0                                                  1                                                              )                .              {\displaystyle {\tilde {A}}=\left({\begin{array}{ccc}-2&-3&-5\\-6&-9&-3\\1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{array}}\right).}  The fact that every column vector in                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is orthogonal to every column vector in                                                         A              ~                                            {\displaystyle {\tilde {A}}}   can be checked by direct computation.  The fact that the spans of these vectors are orthogonal then follows by bilinearity of the dot product. Finally, the fact that these spaces are orthogonal complements follows from the dimension relationships given below.

For a reflexive bilinear form, where                     B        (        u        ,        v        )        =        0              {\displaystyle B(u,v)=0}   implies                     B        (        v        ,        u        )        =        0              {\displaystyle B(v,u)=0}   for all                     u              {\displaystyle u}   and                     v              {\displaystyle v}   in                     V        ,              {\displaystyle V,}   the left and right complements coincide.  This will be the case if                     B              {\displaystyle B}   is a symmetric or an alternating form.The definition extends to a bilinear form on a free module over a commutative ring, and to a sesquilinear form extended to include any free module over a commutative ring with conjugation.= Properties =An orthogonal complement is a subspace of                     V

In finite-dimensional spaces, that is merely an instance of the fact that all subspaces of a vector space are closed.  In infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, some subspaces are not closed, but all orthogonal complements are closed. If                     W              {\displaystyle W}   is a vector subspace of an inner product space the orthogonal complement of the orthogonal complement of                     W              {\displaystyle W}   is the closure of                     W        ,              {\displaystyle W,}   that is,Some other useful properties that always hold are the following.

In this case one defines the orthogonal complement of W to be a subspace of the dual of V defined similarly as the annihilator                              W                      ⊥                          =                  {                      x            ∈                          V                              ∗                                      :            ∀            y            ∈            W            ,            x            (            y            )            =            0                    }                .              {\displaystyle W^{\bot }=\left\{x\in V^{*}:\forall y\in W,x(y)=0\right\}.}  It is always a closed subspace of V∗. There is also an analog of the double complement property.  W⊥⊥ is now a subspace of V∗∗ (which is not identical to V). However, the reflexive spaces have a natural isomorphism i between V and V∗∗. In this case we have                    i                              W            ¯                          =                  W                      ⊥                        ⊥                          .              {\displaystyle i{\overline {W}}=W^{\bot \,\bot }.}  This is a rather straightforward consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem. Applications In special relativity the orthogonal complement is used to determine the simultaneous hyperplane at a point of a world line.  The bilinear form η used in Minkowski space determines a pseudo-Euclidean space of events. The origin and all events on the light cone are self-orthogonal. When a time event and a space event evaluate to zero under the bilinear form, then they are hyperbolic-orthogonal. This terminology stems from the use of two conjugate hyperbolas in the pseudo-Euclidean plane: conjugate diameters of these hyperbolas are hyperbolic-orthogonal.
