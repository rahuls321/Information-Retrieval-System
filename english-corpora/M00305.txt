In numerical analysis and linear algebra, lower–upper (LU) decomposition or factorization factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. The product sometimes includes a permutation matrix as well. LU decomposition can be viewed as the matrix form of Gaussian elimination. Computers usually solve square systems of linear equations using LU decomposition, and it is also a key step when inverting a matrix or computing the determinant of a matrix. The LU decomposition was introduced by the Polish mathematician Tadeusz Banachiewicz in 1938. Definitions Let A be a square matrix. An LU factorization refers to the factorization of A, with proper row and/or column orderings or permutations, into two factors – a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U:                    A        =        L        U        .              {\displaystyle A=LU.}  In the lower triangular matrix all elements above the diagonal are zero, in the upper triangular matrix, all the elements below the diagonal are zero. For example, for a 3 × 3 matrix A, its LU decomposition looks like this:                                          [                                                                                a                                          11                                                                                                            a                                          12                                                                                                            a                                          13                                                                                                                                        a                                          21                                                                                                            a                                          22                                                                                                            a                                          23                                                                                                                                        a                                          31                                                                                                            a                                          32                                                                                                            a                                          33                                                                                            ]                          =                              [                                                                                ℓ                                          11                                                                                        0                                                  0                                                                                                  ℓ                                          21                                                                                                            ℓ                                          22                                                                                        0                                                                                                  ℓ                                          31                                                                                                            ℓ                                          32                                                                                                            ℓ                                          33                                                                                            ]                                                [                                                                                u                                          11                                                                                                            u                                          12                                                                                                            u                                          13                                                                                                                    0                                                                      u                                          22                                                                                                            u                                          23                                                                                                                    0                                                  0                                                                      u                                          33                                                                                            ]                          .              {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}\\a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}\ell _{11}&0&0\\\ell _{21}&\ell _{22}&0\\\ell _{31}&\ell _{32}&\ell _{33}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}u_{11}&u_{12}&u_{13}\\0&u_{22}&u_{23}\\0&0&u_{33}\end{bmatrix}}.}  Without a proper ordering or permutations in the matrix, the factorization may fail to materialize. For example, it is easy to verify (by expanding the matrix multiplication) that                               a                      11                          =                  ℓ                      11                                    u                      11                                {\textstyle a_{11}=\ell _{11}u_{11}}  . If                               a                      11                          =        0              {\textstyle a_{11}=0}  , then at least one of                               ℓ                      11                                {\textstyle \ell _{11}}   and                               u                      11                                {\textstyle u_{11}}   has to be zero, which implies that either L or U is singular. This is impossible if A is nonsingular (invertible). This is a procedural problem. It can be removed by simply reordering the rows of A so that the first element of the permuted matrix is nonzero. The same problem in subsequent factorization steps can be removed the same way; see the basic procedure below.= LU factorization with partial pivoting =It turns out that a proper permutation in rows (or columns) is sufficient for LU factorization. LU factorization with partial pivoting (LUP) refers often to LU factorization with row permutations only:                    P        A        =        L        U        ,              {\displaystyle PA=LU,}  where L and U are again lower and upper triangular matrices, and P is a permutation matrix, which, when left-multiplied to A, reorders the rows of A. It turns out that all square matrices can be factorized in this form, and the factorization is numerically stable in practice. This makes LUP decomposition a useful technique in practice.= LU factorization with full pivoting =An LU factorization with full pivoting involves both row and column permutations:                    P        A        Q        =        L        U        ,              {\displaystyle PAQ=LU,}  where L, U and P are defined as before, and Q is a permutation matrix that reorders the columns of A.= Lower-diagonal-upper (LDU) decomposition =A Lower-diagonal-upper (LDU) decomposition is a decomposition of the form                    A        =        L        D        U        ,              {\displaystyle A=LDU,}  where D is a diagonal matrix, and L and U are unitriangular matrices, meaning that all the entries on the diagonals of L and U are one.= Rectangular matrices =Above we required that A be a square matrix, but these decompositions can all be generalized to rectangular matrices as well. In that case, L and D are square matrices both of which have the same number of rows as A, and U has exactly the same dimensions as A. Upper triangular should be interpreted as having only zero entries below the main diagonal, which starts at the upper left corner. Similarly, the more precise term for U is that it is the "row echelon form" of the matrix A. Example We factorize the following 2-by-2 matrix:                                          [                                                            4                                                  3                                                                              6                                                  3                                                      ]                          =                              [                                                                                ℓ                                          11                                                                                        0                                                                                                  ℓ                                          21                                                                                                            ℓ                                          22                                                                                            ]                                                [                                                                                u                                          11                                                                                                            u                                          12                                                                                                                    0                                                                      u                                          22                                                                                            ]                          .              {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}4&3\\6&3\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}\ell _{11}&0\\\ell _{21}&\ell _{22}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}u_{11}&u_{12}\\0&u_{22}\end{bmatrix}}.}  One way to find the LU decomposition of this simple matrix would be to simply solve the linear equations by inspection.

In this case any two non-zero elements of L and U matrices are parameters of the solution and can be set arbitrarily to any non-zero value. Therefore, to find the unique LU decomposition, it is necessary to put some restriction on L and U matrices. For example, we can conveniently require the lower triangular matrix L to be a unit triangular matrix (i.e. set all the entries of its main diagonal to ones). Then the system of equations has the following solution:                                                                                          ℓ                                      11                                                  =                                  ℓ                                      22                                                                                              =                1                                                                                      ℓ                                      21                                                                                              =                1.5                                                                                      u                                      11                                                                                              =                4                                                                                      u                                      12                                                                                              =                3                                                                                      u                                      22                                                                                              =                −                1.5                                                          {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\ell _{11}=\ell _{22}&=1\\\ell _{21}&=1.5\\u_{11}&=4\\u_{12}&=3\\u_{22}&=-1.5\end{aligned}}}  Substituting these values into the LU decomposition above yields                                          [                                                            4                                                  3                                                                              6                                                  3                                                      ]                          =                              [                                                            1                                                  0                                                                              1.5                                                  1                                                      ]                                                [                                                            4                                                  3                                                                              0                                                  −                  1.5                                                      ]                          .              {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}4&3\\6&3\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\1.5&1\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}4&3\\0&-1.5\end{bmatrix}}.}   Existence and uniqueness = Square matrices =Any square matrix                     A              {\textstyle A}   admits LUP and PLU factorizations. If                     A              {\textstyle A}   is invertible, then it admits an LU (or LDU) factorization if and only if all its leading principal minors are nonzero. If                     A              {\textstyle A}   is a singular matrix of rank                     k              {\textstyle k}  , then it admits an LU factorization if the first                     k              {\textstyle k}   leading principal minors are nonzero, although the converse is not true.If a square, invertible matrix has an LDU (factorization with all diagonal entries of L and U equal to 1), then the factorization is unique. In that case, the LU factorization is also unique if we require that the diagonal of                     L              {\textstyle L}   (or                     U              {\textstyle U}  ) consists of ones.In general, any square matrix                               A                      n            x            n                                {\displaystyle A_{nxn}}   could have one of the followings:1. a unique LU factorization (as mentioned above)2. infinitely many LU factorizations if two or more of any first (n-1) columns are linearly dependent or any of the first (n-1) columns are 0, then A has infinitely many LU factorizations.3. no LU if the first (n-1) columns are non-zero and linearly independent and at least one leading principal minor is zero, then A has no LU decomposition.In Case 3, one can approximate an LU factorization by changing a diagonal entry                               a                      j            j                                {\displaystyle a_{jj}}    to                               a                      j            j                                {\displaystyle a_{jj}}   ± ε  to avoid a zero leading principal minor.= Symmetric positive-definite matrices =If A is a symmetric (or Hermitian, if A is complex) positive-definite matrix, we can arrange matters so that U is the conjugate transpose of L. That is, we can write A as                    A        =        L                  L                      ∗                          .                      {\displaystyle A=LL^{*}.\,}  This decomposition is called the Cholesky decomposition. The Cholesky decomposition always exists and is unique — provided the matrix is positive definite. Furthermore, computing the Cholesky decomposition is more efficient and numerically more stable than computing some other LU decompositions.= General matrices =For a (not necessarily invertible) matrix over any field, the exact necessary and sufficient conditions under which it has an LU factorization are known. The conditions are expressed in terms of the ranks of certain submatrices. The Gaussian elimination algorithm for obtaining LU decomposition has also been extended to this most general case. Algorithms = Closed formula =When an LDU factorization exists and is unique, there is a closed (explicit) formula for the elements of L, D, and U in terms of ratios of determinants of certain submatrices of the original matrix A. In particular,                               D                      1                          =                  A                      1            ,            1                                {\textstyle D_{1}=A_{1,1}}  , and for                     i        =        2        ,        …        ,        n              {\textstyle i=2,\ldots ,n}  ,                               D                      i                                {\textstyle D_{i}}   is the ratio of the                     i              {\textstyle i}  -th principal submatrix to the                     (        i        −        1        )              {\textstyle (i-1)}  -th principal submatrix. Computation of the determinants is computationally expensive, so this explicit formula is not used in practice.= Using Gaussian elimination =The following algorithm is essentially a modified form of Gaussian elimination. Computing an LU decomposition using this algorithm requires                                                         2              3                                                n                      3                                {\displaystyle {\tfrac {2}{3}}n^{3}}   floating-point operations, ignoring lower-order terms.

Moreover, it can be seen that                    L        =                              (                                                            1                                                                                                                                                                                  ℓ                                          2                      ,                      1                                                                                        ⋱                                                                                                                                                              ⋱                                                  1                                                                                                                              ⋮                                                  ⋯                                                                      ℓ                                          n                      +                      1                      ,                      n                                                                                        1                                                                                                                                              ⋮                                                  ⋱                                                  ⋱                                                                                                                  ℓ                                          N                      ,                      1                                                                                        ⋯                                                                      ℓ                                          N                      ,                      n                                                                                        ⋯                                                                      ℓ                                          N                      ,                      N                      −                      1                                                                                        1                                                      )                          .              {\displaystyle L={\begin{pmatrix}1&&&&&\\\ell _{2,1}&\ddots &&&&\\&\ddots &1&&&\\\vdots &\cdots &\ell _{n+1,n}&1&&\\&&\vdots &\ddots &\ddots &\\\ell _{N,1}&\cdots &\ell _{N,n}&\cdots &\ell _{N,N-1}&1\end{pmatrix}}.}  We obtain                     A        =        L        U        .              {\displaystyle A=LU.}  It is clear that in order for this algorithm to work, one needs to have                               a                      n            ,            n                                (            n            −            1            )                          ≠        0              {\displaystyle a_{n,n}^{(n-1)}\neq 0}   at each step (see the definition of                               ℓ                      i            ,            n                                {\displaystyle \ell _{i,n}}  ). If this assumption fails at some point, one needs to interchange n-th row with another row below it before continuing. This is why an LU decomposition in general looks like                               P                      −            1                          A        =        L        U              {\displaystyle P^{-1}A=LU}  .Note that the decomposition obtained through this procedure is a Doolittle decomposition: the main diagonal of L is composed solely of 1s. If one would proceed by removing elements above the main diagonal by adding multiples of the columns (instead of removing elements below the diagonal by adding multiples of the rows), we would obtain a Crout decomposition, where the main diagonal of U is of 1s.Another (equivalent) way of producing a Crout decomposition of a given matrix A is to obtain a Doolittle decomposition of the transpose of A.

This means, for example, that an O(n2.376) algorithm exists based on the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm.= Sparse-matrix decomposition =Special algorithms have been developed for factorizing large sparse matrices. These algorithms attempt to find sparse factors L and U. Ideally, the cost of computation is determined by the number of nonzero entries, rather than by the size of the matrix.These algorithms use the freedom to exchange rows and columns to minimize fill-in (entries that change from an initial zero to a non-zero value during the execution of an algorithm).General treatment of orderings that minimize fill-in can be addressed using graph theory.

Suppose we have already obtained the LUP decomposition of A such that                     P        A        =        L        U              {\textstyle PA=LU}  , so                     L        U                  x                =        P                  b                      {\textstyle LU\mathbf {x} =P\mathbf {b} }  .In this case the solution is done in two logical steps:First, we solve the equation                     L                  y                =        P                  b                      {\textstyle L\mathbf {y} =P\mathbf {b} }   for y.Second, we solve the equation                     U                  x                =                  y                      {\textstyle U\mathbf {x} =\mathbf {y} }   for x.In both cases we are dealing with triangular matrices (L and U), which can be solved directly by forward and backward substitution without using the Gaussian elimination process (however we do need this process or equivalent to compute the LU decomposition itself).The above procedure can be repeatedly applied to solve the equation multiple times for different b. In this case it is faster (and more convenient) to do an LU decomposition of the matrix A once and then solve the triangular matrices for the different b, rather than using Gaussian elimination each time. The matrices L and U could be thought to have "encoded" the Gaussian elimination process.The cost of solving a system of linear equations is approximately                                           2            3                                    n                      3                                {\textstyle {\frac {2}{3}}n^{3}}   floating-point operations if the matrix                     A              {\textstyle A}   has size                     n              {\textstyle n}  . This makes it twice as fast as algorithms based on QR decomposition, which costs about                                           4            3                                    n                      3                                {\textstyle {\frac {4}{3}}n^{3}}   floating-point operations when Householder reflections are used. For this reason, LU decomposition is usually preferred.= Inverting a matrix =When solving systems of equations, b is usually treated as a vector with a length equal to the height of matrix A. In matrix inversion however, instead of vector b, we have matrix B, where B is an n-by-p matrix, so that we are trying to find a matrix X (also a n-by-p matrix):                    A        X        =        L        U        X        =        B        .              {\displaystyle AX=LUX=B.}  We can use the same algorithm presented earlier to solve for each column of matrix X. Now suppose that B is the identity matrix of size n. It would follow that the result X must be the inverse of A.= Computing the determinant =Given the LUP decomposition                     A        =                  P                      −            1                          L        U              {\textstyle A=P^{-1}LU}   of a square matrix A, the determinant of A can be computed straightforwardly as                    det        (        A        )        =        det                  (                      P                          −              1                                )                det        (        L        )        det        (        U        )        =        (        −        1                  )                      S                                    (                                    ∏                              i                =                1                                            n                                                    l                              i                i                                              )                          (                                    ∏                              i                =                1                                            n                                                    u                              i                i                                              )                .              {\displaystyle \det(A)=\det \left(P^{-1}\right)\det(L)\det(U)=(-1)^{S}\left(\prod _{i=1}^{n}l_{ii}\right)\left(\prod _{i=1}^{n}u_{ii}\right).}  The second equation follows from the fact that the determinant of a triangular matrix is simply the product of its diagonal entries, and that the determinant of a permutation matrix is equal to (−1)S where S is the number of row exchanges in the decomposition.In the case of LU decomposition with full pivoting,                     det        (        A        )              {\textstyle \det(A)}   also equals the right-hand side of the above equation, if we let S be the total number of row and column exchanges.The same method readily applies to LU decomposition by setting P equal to the identity matrix.
