  Map of Madhya Pradesh, Republic of India
Madhya Pradesh (commonly abbreviated as MP) is a state in the plains of India. The name "Madhya Pradesh"  means "central region", and  derives from its geographical position.  It is one of the few states of India that is completely surrounded by other states, having neither a border with another country nor a coastline. To its north is Uttar Pradesh. To its west lie Rajasthan and Gujarat, to its south is Maharashtra and to its east is Chhattisgarh, a state that used to be a part of MP till 2000. 
MP has been rather neglected as a travel destination, but in reality, it has a rich feast for those who seek prehistoric paintings, historic forts, religious erotica, or tribal culture. On the flip side, the tourist infrastructure is not very well-developed.

Understand[edit]Madhya Pradesh is the central part of India. Madhya Pradesh originally became a state on 1 November 1965. In 2000, the southeast portion of Madhya Pradesh was split off and became the state of Chhattisgarh. For the entirety of its history, the capital has been Bhopal. Madhya Pradesh has four other major cities in addition to Bhopal which are Indore, Gwalior, Jabalpur and Ujjain. It is divided into many divisions, fifty districts and two hundred blocks. Before Madhya Pradesh was divided, the population was 60,385,118 (India census 2001). The geographical area is 4,434,459 km.
In ancient times Vairisimha II was the king and the capital was Ujjain.  When King Bhoj became king he moved the capital to Dhar. During the independence war, Fort Dhar played an important part in the fight for freedom and produced many freedom fighters. Many tribes played an important role like the Bhils, Rajpurohit and Rajput.
Madhya Pradesh has many large tribes and castes. Tribal groups inhabit the Vindhya mountain range areas of the state. Probably the best-known local clan are the Rajputs, the traditional landlords in the area.
Madhya Pradesh, also called Green Malaw, is the breadbasket of India. Eighty percent of the population depends on agriculture. Wheat, corn, peas, grain, cotton and soybeans are the most important crops. Many dense forests are important resources of timber, providing bamboo, teak and sal. The state is also full of natural resources, including coal, iron and diamonds. The state is also well known for its handicrafts.


Talk[edit]Hindi is the main language used. English knowledge can sometimes be found inside the cities. Do not expect anyone to speak English outside the main cities.
