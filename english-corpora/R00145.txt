== Controversy ==
Sidney town supervisor, Robert McCarthy, began an effort to declare a Muslim cemetery of the Osmanli Naksibendi Hakkani Dergahi (a Sufi Muslim center) illegal. He was quoted saying that the town board "will be seeking to have these bodies disinterred and stop future burials."When questioned about the legal basis for town action he responded, "I don't know what the exact law is". On August 12, 2010, the town board voted unanimously to authorize Town Attorney Joseph A. Ermeti to commence with legal proceedings against the Osmanli Naksibendi Hakkani Dergah. MSNBC's Keith Olbermann brought instant fame to the small town of Sidney when he announced Bob McCarthy as “The Worst Person in the World”  and Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert joked about the residents of Sidney being scared of Muslim vampires.Members of the Sufi Muslim center had contacted and demonstrated to Bob McCarthy that the cemetery was in fact legal (established in 2005 ) and had the permission of the municipal government to establish a cemetery. In addition, both burials were registered with the town. McCarthy forwarded all inquiries to the Town Attorney Joe Ermeti, who delayed response to the Muslim community until October 14, 2010 - the day of Sidney's town meeting. The statement made by Sidney's lawyer and town board said they would not pursue legal charges against the Sufi cemetery, but would also not recognize its legality. McCarthy refused to apologize to the Sufi community and to the town. The Huffington Post published an article detailing the incident which subsequently gained national and international attention. McCarthy still maintained the law was on the side of the Sidney Town Board, while lawyers and Hans Hass, spokesman for the Muslim center, contend otherwise. An official statement was provided by the Muslim center detailing the cemetery issue and legal documentation.
