Nagarahole Tiger Reserve,  previously known as Rajiv Gandhi Nagarahole National Park (Kannada ನಾಗರಹೊಳೆ ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರೀಯ ಉದ್ಯಾನವನ), is in the Cauvery Basin in India's Karnataka State.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
  
The reserve is 93 km from Mysore. It is spread between Kodagu and Mysore districts. The national park has rich forest cover, little streams, valleys and waterfalls.
The place derives its name from Kannada - naga meaning snake and hole referring to streams.
The area was an exclusive hunting reserve of the former rulers of Mysore.
It was set up in 1955 and is one of the best-managed parks in the country. This park is northwest of Bandipur National Park. In 1975 its area stretched to 575 km2. Kabini reservoir separates this park from Bandipur National Park. The climate is tropical; summer is hot and winter is pleasant. The park boasts a healthy tiger-predator ratio. Tiger, gaur and elephant are much denser here than in Bandipur.
The office of the Deputy Conservator of Forests is in Hunsur, about 47 km away from Nagarhole.

Terrain[edit]
Mostly moist mixed deciduous forest (Tectona grandis, Dalbergia latifolia) in the southern parts, dry tropical forest (Wrightia tinctoria, Acacia) towards east, i.e. Bandipur and Sub mountain hill valley swamp forest (Eugenia).

Flora and fauna[edit]

Mammals: elephant, jackal, tiger, panther, gaur, muntjac, sambar, Spotted deer, mongoose, Civet cat, hyena, and Sloth bear.
Reptiles: King Cobra, krait, python, viper, tortoise, Monitor lizard, toads etc.
The main trees found are rosewood, teak, sandalwood and silver oak.
Climate[edit]
Temperature during summer would be around 32°C. Winter is brief from November to January and has the temperature dipping to 12 °C and rains from June to October.
During the summer heat, March and April, the waterholes are dry and the animals congregate near the lake, so it is the best time to see wildlife. From November to February, the weather is more pleasant though, for hiking or touring.
From July to October, the monsoons may make the roads impassable,  and safaris may not operate. It is difficult to spot wildlife during this season.
