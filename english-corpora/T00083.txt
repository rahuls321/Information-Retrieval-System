History[edit]
It commemorates the fight of a mother and daughter," Sammakka and Saralamma" (also known as Sarakka), with the reigning rulers against an unjust law.
Game
There are many legends about the miraculous powers of Sammakka. According to a tribal story, about 6-7 centuries ago, that is in the 13th century, some tribal leaders who went for a hunting found a new born girl (Sammakka) emitting enormous light playing amidst tigers. She was taken to their habitation, and the head of the tribe adopted her and brought up as a chief. She later became the saviour of the tribals of the region. She was married to Pagididda Raju, the tribal chief of the Koyas. The Kakatiyas (who ruled the region with its headquarters in Warangal City between 1000 AD and 1380 AD). She was blessed with 2 daughters and one son namely Sarakka, Nagulamma and Jampanna respectively. When King Prataprudra of the Kakatiyas imposed taxes on the Koya Tribe, the chief of the tribe was unable to pay them. As a result, Prataprudra declared war on the Koya Tribe. All the tribal people had turned into warriors. Pagididda Raju was killed in the battle. Angered with grief, Sammakka entered the battlefield along with her daughter, Saralamma, her son, Jampanna and also her son-in-law Govinda Raju. Sammakka had almost won when Saralamma died in the battle and Jampanna died in this attack and fell bleeding into a vaagu (stream) and later the whole "Sampangi Vaagu", that is the name of the stream has turned red from the blood due to which it was later on called "Jampanna Vaagu" near the place where the present festival is taking place.
Sammakka had gone to a hill named Chilakala Gutta and all alone, she manifested into a vermilion casket. (Kumkum Bharani). After that the tribe and devotees have been believing that Sammakka and Saralamma were manifestations of Adi Parashakti and they have been protecting them. 
The main objective of the jatara is to bring the vermilion casket to Medaram, take a bath in Jampanna Vagu and offer jaggery to Sammakka and Saralamma. The jatara was only done in the throne of Sammakka and later a separate throne was built for Saralamma.

Jampanna Vagu[edit]
Jampanna Vagu, originally known as "Sampangi Vagu" is a tributary to the river Godavari. According to history, Jampanna was a tribal warrior and the son of tribal goddess Sammakka. The Jampanna Vagu took his name as he died in a battle fighting against the Kakatiyan Army in that stream. Tribals believe that taking a holy dip in the  water of Jampanna Vagu honours and reminds them of the sacrifice of their gods who saved them and also induces courage in their souls.
There is a bridge constructed on top of Jampanna Vagu, known as the Jampanna Vagu Bridge.

Transport[edit]
The Jatara venue is situated at about 100 km from Warangal, 170 km from Karimnagar, 190 km from Suryapet, 250 km from Hyderabad and 320 km from Rajahmundry (via Bhadrachalam & Manuguru).
Until 1978, the only way to reach Medaram was by a bullock cart. In 1978 then the Andhra Pradesh State Government declared the 1000-yr old festival as official and laid down a paved road. TSRTC runs multiple buses to the venue during the Jatara period. Also, many private vehicles render their services for plying the visitors and aerial view services (such as using a helicopter) are also provided during this festival.
The Jatara is very well facilitated with roads, drinking water, sanitation, health and hygiene by the Government of Telangana.[3]


In Popular Culture[edit]
