He participated in the 2007 European Athletics U23 Championships in Debrecen and was a semi-finalist in both the 100 and 200 m, before going on to claim a silver medal in the relay with colleagues Dany Gonçalves, Ricardo Martins and Yazaldes Nascimento. At the Osaka 2007 World Athletics Championships, Abrantes reached the quarter-finals of the 200 m.  As well as achieving the entry standard time for the Olympic Games 2008 he also beat his personal best and national under-23 record of 20.48 seconds.
He qualified to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics, but was eliminated in the opening rounds. The following year he improved his 100 m personal best to 10.19 seconds (the third best time by a Portuguese sprinter ever). He achieved a second-place finish at the European Team Championships in the 200 meters, behind only to Dwain Chambers. At the Portuguese Championships he was runner-up to Francis Obikwelu with a wind-assisted run of 10.13 seconds. He was not in shape to compete in the 200 m at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, but he did run in the national relay team.


== 2010 ==
He managed to reach the entry standard for the European Championships in Barcelona, the time being slightly above his personal best. He participated in the 200 meters reaching the semi-finals. In the 4x100 meter relay, along with fellow Ricardo Monteiro, Francis Obikwelu and João Ferreira, he beat the national record to 38.88 seconds. It was the first time a Portuguese team completed the relay race in under 39 seconds.


== 2011 ==
Having left Sporting Clube de Portugal, he began the 2010/2011 season as an individual athlete. Despite competing as individual, he surprised everyone at the National Indoor Championships by winning the 60 m race, beating fellow countryman Francis Obikwelu.  Abrantes set a new personal best of 6.65 seconds. 
At the 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships in Paris, he qualified for the semi-finals with a time of 6.65 (matching his personal best), but did not make the final.
