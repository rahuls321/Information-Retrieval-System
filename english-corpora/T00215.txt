History[edit]
In 1891, Maharaja Rajendra of Patiala incurred the rage of Lord Kitchener. It led to the restriction of his entry in the Indian summer capital, Shimla. This incensed the Maharaja and he vowed to build a new summer retreat for himself. So he rebuilt the place (Chail) as per his requirements.
After accession to the Indian Union, Maharaja of Patiala donated most of his buildings to Chail Military School and Government of India.

Geography[edit]
Chail is situated at an altitude of 2,250 m. The place is surrounded by the forests of chir pine and gigantic deodars. Shimla, Solan and Kasauli can also be viewed at night from here. Chail is pleasant in summers and cold in winter. Average annual rainfall is about 150 mm.

'Stone Kumbd' - Shiv Mandir
The road from Chail to Kufri winds with a lot of twists and turns through the deodar forests and is very lonely and dangerous as it is just a single road, in fact all roads leading to Chail are single roads which are difficult to motor as the widths are very less and have a lot of turns. One must never drive here during night and should avoid during the day as well, no wonder that very little vehicles are found on these roads.  There are many small villages on the way and eateries that serve local food and chai (Indian sweet tea).
In literature[edit]
Letitia Elizabeth Landon provides two poetical illustrations for plates of locations in this vicinity in her Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1839. These are Village of Koghera, Near the Choor Mountain, which reflects on the beauty of the scenery, and Crossing the Choor Mountains, which is more concerned with the hardships endured by explorers. The accompanying notes record that "During a considerable part of the year, the Choor is hoary with snow; and when moonlight falls upon the scene, an effect is produced as if floods of molten silver were poured over the surface. Moonlight in these regions assumes a novel charm."
