  Mysore Palace
Mysore, officially Mysuru, is the second-most populous city of the state of Karnataka after Bangalore. It was the capital of the Wodeyar dynasty, and is considered to be the cultural capital of Karnataka. Mysore is among the cleanest and best planned cities in India.


Understand[edit]
Mysore's recorded history dates back over a thousand years. Its name has a mythological origin. According to Hindu mythology, the demon Mahishasura was slain by the Goddess Chamundi at the place where present-day Mysore is located. A statue of Mahishasura stands on Chamundi Hill on the outskirts of the city.
In later times, the city rose to prominence when it became the capital of a breakaway vassal state of the Vijayanagara Empire, ruled by the Wodeyar family in 1584. In 1610, the king Chamaraja Wodeyar shifted the capital to nearby Srirangapatna. Hyder Ali, who was a commander in the army, usurped power in the late 18th century. Hyder Ali was succeeded by his son Tipu Sultan, who fought and lost a war with the British, dying in battle in 1799.
The British restored the Wodeyars as their puppet rulers and shifted the capital back to Mysore. The Wodeyars had substantial internal autonomy and the Kingdom of Mysore (which comprised a large portion of present-day Karnataka) was one of the best administered in India. After independence, the kingdom was merged into the Indian Union and the capital of Mysore state was moved to nearby Bangalore where the British maintained their army. The name of the state too was eventually changed to "Karnataka" in 1973.
The dynasty is still well loved and the people of Mysore are still nostalgic for the grandeur of the earlier times. The palaces built by the Wodeyars and the annual celebrations of Dusshera are holdovers of that period.
Mysore has evolved from being a sleepy and quiet city to one that has become the most important in the state after Bangalore. The malls, apartment complexes, new and improved roads, supermarkets the advent of IT and BPO firms and a growing young and dynamic workforce reflect the transformation of the city in the 21st century. The regal city is striking a balance between olden times and modernity, resulting in the city being both old and new.

During the weekends, these buses can fill up, but most do not allow you to purchase your tickets in advance.

By car[edit]
Mysore is approximately 140 km from Bangalore, with a 4-lane highway (2 lanes in each direction) connecting the 2 cities. The traffic is fairly heavy but the drive is  comfortable apart from the unmarked speed bumps that show up at random intervals. As of July 2011, there are approximately 25 to 30 speed bumps. The distance and bumps make you reach Mysore from Bangalore in 3½ hours by car. Some speed bumps are not even marked by zebra crossing or no symbols to indicate the speed bumps.
You don't really need to hire a car and driver while staying in Mysore, as all the tourist sites are walking distance or a cheap ride by rickshaw. Alternatively, if you feel the need to have a car and driver during your trip, it is very easy to arrange it once you arrive.

Getting around in Mysore is cheaper than most Indian cities.

By hitch-hiking[edit]
Hitch-hiking: Taking a lift, most of the locals (mainly 2 wheelers) are very helpful and generally stop to give a lift. Might be difficult on the main arterial roads because of the Traffic Police as helmets are compulsory for pillion riders as well.

By bus[edit]
City buses originate from a separate City Bus Station 2 km from the Railway Station.
Frequent bus service is available to all major tourist and residential areas of the city. Volvo air-conditioned buses are available to Chamundi Hills, KRS-Brindavan Garden, Zoo, Infosys, and the European Quarter (Gokula).

 BookCab, ☏ +91 92 4100 4100, bookings@bookcab.in. 24 hr. 
By auto-rickshaw[edit]
Auto-rickshaws have meters, but drivers politely refuse to turn down the meters especially at railway stations, bus stations, etc. The more the driver suspects that you are a tourist judging based by your attire, looks and luggage, the less the chance that they will agree to use the meter. Price is ₹11 per km, with a minimum fare of ₹25. Try to insist on using the meter; threatening to call the police sometimes works when the rickshaw driver pretends that the meter is broken and wants a flat fee.
At the railway station or city bus stand, go straight to the prepaid auto-rickshaw counter and tell them your destination (you have to pay a rupee (₹1) for this service). They will give you a slip with the fare printed, along with the destination and auto rickshaw registration number. When you arrive at the destination you just pay what is printed on the slip.
You can always get the help of a traffic police officer to negotiate with the auto driver. They are really helpful.

By horse-drawn carriage[edit]
Horse-drawn carriages (known as a tanga) are a common sight and way of getting around the tourist hotspots in Mysore, especially the landmarks surrounding the palace.

Learn[edit]
Mysore is a significant educational hub, the foundations for which were laid by King Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV during his enlightened rule. Today, the city can boast of seven engineering and two medical colleges. The first engineering college established in Mysore was the National Institute of Engineering in 1946, the second oldest in Karnataka (after UVCE Bangalore). Formal medical education began in 1930 when the Mysore Medical College was transferred from Bangalore to Mysore.
Mysore is well known for its prowess in Sanskrit, the mother language of many Indian languages. The city is occasionally referred to as the Sanskrit capital of India. A Sanskrit daily newspaper called Sudharma is published from Mysore for a nominal price of ₹1.

Mysore University has the distinction of being the first university established in Karnataka, the sixth oldest in the country, and the first one in India established outside of a British province. Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV took the initiative in founding the university. It was named Manasagangotri (literally meaning "fountainhead of the Ganges of the mind") by the poet laureate, Kuvempu. 
  Devaraj Urs road is the main shopping district of Mysore city
Buy[edit]
  Sweet-meat shop at the Mall of Mysore
  Mall of Mysore
Mysore is famous for silk sarees (Mysore Silk), sandalwood carvings and the many varieties of perfumed incense sticks. Mysore's marketplaces can be a good place to start, like Ashoka Road, Sayyaji Rao Road and from a mix of Western and Indian traditional shopping head to Devaraj Urs Road. To experience one of India's best markets head to Devaraja Market where tourists and locals alike shop for daily fruit and vegetables as well as the rows and rows of flowers and various spices. Devaraja market is on Dhanwanthri Road.
On the east row of the Devaraja Market, there is an oil shop with two brothers, Azam and Adil, who always pull in tourists for a nice conversation and maybe some chai. They have some good recommendations for food and things around the city so give them a visit. Their shop has a row of the watercolor powder, about 1/3rd from the north end.
Be warned, however. There are quite a lot of perfume sellers that sell inferior goods, don't be tempted by nice boxes and free gifts. As a rule, if it looks like a bargain, the perfume is poor quality. The real stuff is normally found further from the centre, but is mostly for export.

  Dosa Point Restaurant, Ramaswamy Circle
  Breakfast in Mysore style
Mysore is known for the traditional sweet, the Mysore Pak. Mysore Pak is a sweet dish generally cut into rectangular pieces and is made out of gram (chickpea) flour, sugar (or jaggery) and lots of ghee. Sold all over the city although arguably the best Mysore Pak from Guru Sweets near the small clock tower.
South Indian breakfast favourites like idlis, sambars, masala dosas are widely available and quite good. It is not clear if the Mysore Masala Dosa (a fermented crepe made from rice batter, black lentils, potato, and onions) originated in Mysore, but you can try asking. You can find some of Karnataka's specialty dishes like:

Bisibele Baath - Made of rice and lentils with a lot of local spices. This is one of the most sought after dishes of Mysore. It is served hot and usually costs ₹25 in an average restaurant.
Idli Sambar - Different from Idli and Sambar. Since the idlis are put in a bowl with steaming sambar poured over them, the aroma and spicy effect is marvellous and costs less than ₹20.
Masala Poori - This is the most favourite food item of the Mysorean people. You can see young boys selling these 'chat' items on the sides of the pavement with all the ingredients beautifully arranged on wicker stools. For ₹15, you get crispy poories along with ten to twelve spices mixed in a hot 'pani' background. The whole thing is an experience to undergo. Some restaurants have separate 'chat' sections selling Pani Poori, Masala Poori, Bombay Chat and other varieties.
Raagi and Akki Rotis - They are similar to tortillas but made of raagi (English: coracan, finger Millet) or rice flour along with black cumin, asafoetida, fresh coriander, green chillies and finely chopped onions.
Raagi Mudde – A staple food in some of Kannadiga households in the Cauvery Basin. It is made by cooking raagi flour in water and later rolling it into thick consistency balls. Raagi Mudde is swallowed and not chewed after dipping into ghee and sambar.

Night life[edit]
There is no night life in Mysore and no one understands the phrase 'night life'. Shops and restaurants down their shutters before 10PM. Restaurants do not open early in the morning, shops take three-hour lunch breaks, and even buses are few between 1PM and 4PM because the drivers and conductors are having their lunch. This laid back lifestyle can irritate people, although some can accept it within a few days.

Stay safe[edit]
Mysore is regarded as a safe and peaceful city. However, if you plan to wander around during the night, it is suggested that you be watchful, as a few incidents of purse and chain snatching are reported every once in awhile. It is good idea to be alert if you are using an autorickshaw during when it is late, especially if you are alone. Also be careful when paying money to the autorickshaw drivers since they may tout non-locals, and can overcharge and decline using the meter at certain places and times. Note that hire taxi services are another option in Mysore.
The police in Mysore are helpful and friendly. Do not hesitate to request for assistance. You can reach the police control room by dialling 108 from a mobile phone or alternatively, 100 from a landline.
The people of Mysore are by and large peace-loving and hospitable. Mysore is one of the places in India where travellers can get around comfortably without worrying and not get bombarded by touts, which can happen in other parts of the country.
