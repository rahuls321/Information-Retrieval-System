SECTION XXIII
"The Brahmana said, 'In this connection, O blessed lady, is cited the
ancient story of what kind the institution is of the five sacrificing
priests. The learned know this to be a great principle that Prana and
Apana and Udana and Samana and Vyana are the five sacrificing priests.'"
"The Brahmana's wife said, 'That naturally there are seven sacrificing
priests is what was my former conviction. Let the great principle be
declared to 'me as to how, verily, the number is five of the sacrificing
priests.'"
'The Brahmana said, 'The wind nursed by Prana afterwards takes birth in
Apana. The wind nursed in Apana then becomes developed into Vyana. Nursed
by Vyana, the wind is then developed into Udana. Nursed in Udana, the
wind is then generated as Samana. Those good beings in days of yore asked
the first-born Grandsire, saying--Do thou say who amongst us is the
foremost. He (whom thou wilt indicate) will be our chief.'
"Brahmana said, 'He upon whose extinction all the life-breaths become
extinct in the bodies of living creatures, he upon whose moving they
move, is verily the foremost (among you). Do ye go where ye like.'
"Prana said, 'Upon my extinction all the life-breaths become extinct in
the bodies of living creatures. Upon my moving they once more move. I am
(therefore) the foremost. Behold, I go into extinction!'
"The Brahmana continued, 'Prana then became extinct and once more moved
about. Then Samana and Udana also, O blessed one, said these words--Thou
dost not dwell here, pervading all this, as we do. Thou art not the
foremost amongst us, O Prana. (Only) Apana is under thy dominion. Prana
then moved about, and unto him Apana spoke.'
"Apana said, 'When I become extinct, all the life-winds become extinct in
the bodies of living creatures. When I move about, they again move about.
I am, therefore, the foremost. Behold, I go into extinction!'
"The Brahmana continued, 'Unto Apana who said so, both Vyana and Udana
said--O Apana, thou art not the foremost. (Only) Prana is under thy
dominion. Then Apana began to move about. Vyana once more addressed him
saying, I am the foremost of all (the life-winds). Listen, for what
reason. When I become extinct, all the life-winds become extinct in the
bodies of living creatures. When I move about, they once more move about.
I am (therefore) the foremost. Behold, I go into extinction!'
"The Brahmana continued, 'Then Vyana went into extinction and once more
began to move about. At this, Prana and Apana and Udana and Samana
addressed him, saying, 'Thou art not the foremost among us, O Vyana!
(Only) Samana is under thy dominion--Vyana then began to move about and
Samana said unto him,--I am the foremost of you all. Listen, for what
reason. When I become extinct, all the life-winds become extinct in the
bodies of living creatures. When I begin to move about, they once more
move about. Hence, I am the foremost. Behold, I go into extinction! Then
Samana began to move about. Unto him Udana said, I am the foremost of all
the life-winds. Listen, for what reason. When I become extinct, all the
life-winds become extinct in the bodies of living creatures. When I move
about they once more move about. Hence, I am the foremost. Behold, I go
into extinction!--Then Udana, after having gone into extinction, began
once more to move about, Prana and Apana and Samana and Vyana said, unto
him, O Udana, thou art not the foremost one among us, only Vyana is under
thy dominion.'
"The Brahmana continued, 'Unto them assembled together, the Lord of
creatures, Brahma, said, 'No one of you is superior to others. Ye are all
endued with particular attributes. All are foremost in their own spheres,
and all possess special attributes. Thus said unto them, that were
assembled together, the Lord of all creatures. There is one that is
unmoving, and one that is moving. In consequence of special attributes,
there are five life-winds. My own self is one. That one accumulates into
many forms. Becoming friendly unto one another, and gratifying one
another, depart in peace. Blessings to ye, do ye uphold one another!'"
