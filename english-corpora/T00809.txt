Tosham rock inscription[edit]
Main article: Tosham rock inscription
  Tosham rock inscription, dating from 4th to 5th century, is an epigraph documenting the establishment of a monastery and the building of water tanks at water cascade for followers of the Satvata (ancient Yadava kingdom)
Two interesting antiquities are to be seen in the neighborhood of Tosham. A baradari and another Sanskrit inscription on a rock on the face of the hill to the west of the town.[5] The Toshām rock inscription is an epigraphic record documenting the establishment of a monastery and the building of water tanks for followers of the Sātvata religion. Found in Tosham, Haryana (India), It is not dated but can be assigned to the early fifth century CE. The inscription records the lineage and building activities of a line of Sātvata religious preceptors (ācārya) dating to the 4th and 5th centuries CE. This is an important record for the history of the Vaiṣṇava faith. The kinship and clan position of the Sātvatas is described in the article on the Yadavas. It does not appear to have been as yet satisfactorily translated. It seems to refer to a Scythian king Tushara who appears to have conquered the Gupta Galotkacha who reigned from about A. D. 50 to A. D. 79 and is referred to in the inscription. There appears to be evidence to show that the Tosham hill was a monastery of Buddhist monks or Bhikshus. The date of the inscription is said to be A. D. 162–224.[5]

Tosham rock paintings[edit]
In 2013, rudimentary rock paintings (supposedly circa 5th century CE) at the site of Tosham rock inscription were discovered. These rock painting included several figures, such as a royal family, a saint, and dinosaur-like creature.[6]
