SECTION XLI
"Brahmana said, 'That Mahat who was first produced is called Egoism. When
it sprang up as I, it came to be called as the second creation. That
Egoism is said to be the source of all creatures, for these have sprung
from its modifications. It is pure effulgence and is the supporter of
consciousness. It is Prajapati. It is a deity, the creator of deities,
and of mind. It is that which creates the three worlds. It is said to be
that which feels--I am all this.--That is the eternal world existing for
those sages who are contented with knowledge relating to the soul, who
have meditated on the soul, and who have won success by Vedic study and
sacrifices. By consciousness of soul one enjoys the qualities. That
source of all creatures, that creator of all creatures, creates (all
creatures) even in this way. It is that which causes all changes. It is
that which causes all beings to move. By its own light it illuminates the
universe likewise.'"
