Development and production[edit]
The Science Channel has been highlighting what VP of Production Bernadette McDaid calls the "Rock Stars of Science"[3] and physics outreach such as Michio Kaku and Brian Cox. "We wanted to merge our 'Rock Stars of Science' ... with the superstars of pop culture."[3] When Science general manager Deborah Myers heard that Morgan Freeman was very interested in things to do with the universe and space and "asks the big philosophical questions",[3] she approached Freeman and his producer and proposed making a series together.[3]
On February 17, 2011, Sean Carroll confirmed on his Twitter page that filming of season 2 of Through the Wormhole began.[4] On May 17, 2011, Discovery confirmed the second season would premiere on Science on June 8, 2011.[5] An episode from the second season was supposed to air on July 13, 2011,[5] but went unaired. It was later released on the season 2 DVD on November 22, 2011 as the sixth episode.[6]
On January 3, 2012, Sean Carroll posted a picture on his Twitter page, mentioning that it was taken during the taping of season 3.[7] Season 3 began with a special episode on March 6, 2012,[8] and the remaining nine episodes began airing on June 6, 2012.[9]
Season 4 of Through the Wormhole began with a special episode on March 20, 2013,[10] and the remaining nine episodes began airing on June 5, 2013.[11]
On October 9, 2013, the Science Channel began airing enhanced episodes of the show under the title Beyond the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman.[12]
Season 5 of Through the Wormhole began with a special episode on March 5, 2014,[13] and the remaining nine episodes began airing on June 4, 2014.[14]
On March 10, 2014, series producer Anthony Lund stated in an interview with the Los Angeles Post-Examiner that "Wormhole season 6 is a GO, and I’m dreaming of new, thought provoking ideas to explore with this show."[15]
Season 6 of Through the Wormhole premiered on April 29, 2015.[16] Season 6 consists of six episodes, unlike the previous seasons, which all have ten (except season 1, which has 8 episodes).[17]
On March 31, 2016, Science Channel announced it would return for a seventh season,[18] which premiered on August 30, 2016. The eighth and final season premiered on April 25, 2017.

Season 1 (2010)[edit]
No.overallNo. inseasonTitleOriginal air date11"Is There a Creator?"June 9, 2010 (2010-06-09)
It's perhaps the biggest, most controversial mystery in the cosmos. Did our Universe just come into being by random chance, or was it created by a God who nurtures and sustains all life? The latest science is showing that the four forces governing our universe are phenomenally finely tuned. So finely that it had led many to the conclusion that someone, or something, must have calibrated them. While skeptics hold that new findings are neither conclusive nor evidence of a divine creator, some cutting edge physicists are already positing who this God is: an alien gamester who's created our world as the ultimate SIM game for his own amusement. It's an answer as compelling as it is disconcerting.
22"The Riddle of Black Holes"June 16, 2010 (2010-06-16)
They are the most powerful objects in the universe. Nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of a black hole. Astronomers now believe there are billions of them out in the cosmos, swallowing up planets, even entire stars in violent feeding frenzies. New theoretical research into the twisted reality of black holes suggests that three-dimensional space could be an illusion. That reality actually takes place on a two-dimensional hologram at the edge of the universe.
33"Is Time Travel Possible?"June 23, 2010 (2010-06-23)
Einstein's Theory of Relativity says that time travel is perfectly possible — if you're going forward. Finding a way to travel backwards requires breaking the speed of light, which so far seems impossible. But now, strange-but-true phenomena such as quantum non-locality, where particles instantly teleport across vast distances, may give us a way to make the dream of traveling back and forth through time a reality. Step into a time machine and rewrite history, bring loved ones back to life, control our destinies. But if we succeed, what are the consequences of such freedom? Will we get trapped in a plethora of paradoxes and multiple universes that will destroy the fabric of the universe?
44"What Happened Before the Beginning?"June 30, 2010 (2010-06-30)
Every cosmologist and astronomer agrees: our Universe is 13.7 billion years old. Using cutting-edge technology, scientists are now able to take a snapshot of the Universe a mere heartbeat after its birth. Armed with hypersensitive satellites, astronomers look back in time to the very moment of creation, when all the matter in the Universe exploded into existence. It is here that we uncover an unsolved mystery as old as time itself - if the Universe was born, where did it come from? Meet the leading scientists who have now discovered what they believe to be the origin of our Universe, and a window into the time before time.

Features scientists Edwin Hubble, Martin Bojowald, Neil Turok and Paul Steinhardt, and treats of issues around the Big Bang, initial singularity, the string theory, the M-theory, dark energy and gravitational waves.
55"How Did We Get Here?"July 7, 2010 (2010-07-07)
Everywhere we look, life exists in both the most hospitable of environments and in the most extreme. Yet we have only ever found life on our planet. How did the stuff of stars come together to create life as we know it? What do we really mean by 'life'? And will unlocking this mystery help us find life elsewhere?

     Features the research and ideas of geologist Stephen J Mojzsis, chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey and their student Jeffrey Bada, Jen Blank of a search for extraterrestrial intelligence project, biologist Jack Szostak, chemist John Sutherland, physicist Paul Davies and microbial geobiologist/biogeochemist Felisa Wolfe-Simon, and planetary scientist Ben Weiss. Tackles the Hadean period, shadow biospheres, a Winogradsky column, life among the toxic chemicals of Mono Lake, ALH84001 and life on Mars.
66"Are We Alone?"July 14, 2010 (2010-07-14)
Aliens almost certainly do exist. So why haven't we yet met E.T.? It turns out we're only just developing instruments powerful enough to scan for them, and science sophisticated enough to know where to look. As a result, race is on to find the first intelligent aliens. But what would they look like, and how would they interact with us if we met? The answers may come to us sooner than we imagine, for one leading astronomer believes she may already have heard a hint of their first efforts to communicate.

Featuring astrobiologist Lynn Rothschild of NASA Ames Research Center, astronomer Jill Tarter, physicist and SETI projects affiliate Paul Davies, astronomer Geoff Marcy and his student Paul Butler, and space scientist William Borucki. This episode talks about the Murchison meteorite, the Allen Telescope Array, 51 Pegasi b, and the Kepler Space Telescope mission.
77"What Are We Really Made Of?"July 21, 2010 (2010-07-21)
Our understanding of the universe and the nature of reality itself has drastically changed over the last 100 years, and it's on the verge of another seismic shift. In a 17-mile-long tunnel buried 570 feet beneath the Franco-Swiss border, the world's largest and most powerful atom smasher, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), is powering up. Its goal is nothing less than recreating the first instants of creation, when the universe was unimaginably hot and long-extinct forms of matter sizzled and cooled into stars, planets, and ultimately, us. These incredibly small and exotic particles hold the keys to the greatest mysteries of the universe. What we find could validate our long-held theories about how the world works and what we are made of. Or, all of our notions about the essence of what is real will fall apart.

Features Argonne National Laboratory's Bob Stanek and the Advanced Photon Source, Ernest Rutherford's probe into the structure of the atom through M.I.T. professor Steve Nahn's use of the LHC, antimatter, particle physicist Frank Close, antimatter investigator Joel Fajans, the Bevatron particle accelerator, the particle zoo, Fermilab and its Tevatron, experimental physicist Leon Lederman, the weak force and radioactive decay, the strong force and the proton, photons and electromagnetic force, electroweak unification, the Standard Model, theoretical physicist Peter Higgs and the Higgs boson and force particle, CERN, the CMS and ATLAS detectors, and the LHC Quench incident.
88"Beyond the Darkness"July 28, 2010 (2010-07-28)
What is the universe made of? If you answered stars, planets, gas and dust, you'd be dead wrong. Thirty years ago, scientists first realized that some unknown dark substance was affecting the way galaxies moved. Today, they think there must be five times as much dark matter as regular matter out there. But they have no idea what it is — only that it's not made of atoms, or any other matter we are familiar with. And Dark Matter is not the only strange substance in the Universe — a newly discovered force, called Dark Energy, seems to be pushing the very fabric of the cosmos apart.
Season 2 (2011)[edit]
No.overallNo. inseasonTitleOriginal air date91"Is There Life After Death?"June 8, 2011 (2011-06-08)
In the premiere episode of the second season, Morgan Freeman dives deep into this provocative question that has mystified humans since the beginning of time. Modern physics and neuroscience are venturing into this once hallowed ground, and radically changing our ideas of life after death. Freeman serves as host to this polarized debate, where scientists and spiritualists attempt to define "what is consciousness", while cutting edge quantum mechanics could provide the answer to what happens when we die. Eben Alexander, Bruce Greyson, Stuart Hameroff, Giulio Tononi, Christof Koch, and Douglas Hofstadter are interviewed.

The 21 grams experiment to determine the weight of the human soul is discussed. Next, Steve Potter's Hybrot is explained.
102"Is There an Edge to the Universe?"June 15, 2011 (2011-06-15)
In 1543, Nicholas Copernicus proves that the Earth is not the center of the cosmos. The "after-glow" is the Big Bang from 13.7 billion years ago is called the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is the supporting evidence that the "Big Bang" occurred. But since we can only see as far as light has traveled in that time, we can't actually make out the edge of the universe. After the Big Bang, the universe balloons up at an incredible rate in the process of inflation. 
Neil Cornish, a Montana State University professor, is interviewed. Archytas of ancient Greece is the first person known to have ponder the question of whether the universe has an edge. Janna Levin compares the shape of the universe to the 1979 Asteroids game. Jean-Pierre Luminet is interviewed. WMAP of NASA photographs the CMB (cosmic radiation) for five years.

Glenn D. Starkman and Sasha Kashlinsky are interviewed. Dark flow is the attraction of matter in the universe in one direction. Laura Mersini-Houghton advances string theory to explain a multiverse structure from which our universe is born. Mersini-Houghton contends that one universe acts as the Great Attractor of another universe to cause the "dark flow."
113"Does Time Really Exist?"June 22, 2011 (2011-06-22)
Einstein discovered that time is relative while Isaac Newton had thought of time as absolute. Time runs faster for astronauts than people on Earth; people on Earth experience time more slowly because they are closer to the gravitational field of the massive Earth.
Studies have shown that time goes by faster as we age.[19]
In ancient Greece, Parmenides contended that motion is impossible. Likewise, it was argued that time is an illusion. Julian Barbour claims that the Wheeler–DeWitt equation supports his idea that time doesn't exist! The Wheeler–DeWitt equation doesn't depend on time. Contrarians contend that the Wheeler–DeWitt equation shows that one can't reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics and that time is real.
The Fermi Space Telescope will measure if the speed of a photon of light from 13 billion years ago is different from the speed of light now.
Steve Weinstein posits that time may have more than one dimension although time is traditionally treated as a scalar quantity; the majority of physicists see time as a quantity with one dimension, though.

Interviewed experts: Roger W. Smith (watch designer), Lee Smolin, Sean M. Carroll, David Eagleman, Julian Barbour, Tim Maudlin, Steven Weinstein (philosopher).

124"Are There More than Three Dimensions?"June 29, 2011 (2011-06-29)
  Open strings attached to a pair of D-branesWe move and live in three dimensions: length, width, and height. However, Einstein revealed what was once unimaginable: time is actually a dimension and linked with space itself. To reconcile the massive cosmic and minuscule quantum worlds, physicists are realizing four dimensions may not be enough. Tim Tait believes that a fourth dimension may explain the mystery of dark matter. Others are unraveling up to eleven dimensions.
A hypercube can have 4 dimensions. 
Dark matter affects the way stars rotate around galaxies. In 2008, NASA launched the Fermi Space Telescope to pick up intense radiation known as gamma rays [gamma rays are much more energetic than X rays ] emitted by exploding stars.[20] In addition, the Fermi Space Telescope is supposed to detect from the gamma rays from the photons of dark matter.
As of 2011, no physicist has found any physical evidence of strings (which supposedly are vibrating strings that make up sub-atomic particles) at the Large Hadron Collider. However, turturous mathematical evidence has emerged of objects that make up the unseen strings; these strings interact with spacial planes knows as D-branes. Strings and their complementary D-branes are only shown to exist in complex mathematical exercises.
Gravity is associated with closed strings. Within the paradigm of string theory, a graviton is not an elementary particle but a closed-loop string.
Renate Loll believes that string theory "itself is wrong," Freeman narrates.

Interviewed experts: Susan R. Barry, Lisa Randall, Timothy M. P. Tait, Maria Spiropulu, Joseph Polchinski, Eric Adelberger (a winner of the 2021 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics at the University of Washington), Renate Loll.

135"Is There a Sixth Sense?"July 6, 2011 (2011-07-06)
Can we perceive objects and events beyond the world detected by our five senses? The true limits of our human brain remain a scientific mystery. New studies in neuroscience are showing that our minds can really detect events and objects that our conscious selves know nothing about. Can we predict events in the future? Is there such a thing as a global consciousness? Could physical laws on the cusp of being discovered be at the root of all this?
Blindsight has been studied. Schrödinger's cat is supposed to show that "nothing in this universe is certain until someone makes a measurement," narrates Freeman. Eugene Wigner argued that consciousness is necessary for existence.
In the 1950s, Richard Feynman found "advanced wave" solutions to Maxwell's equations from the 1860s. Freeman narrates that matter traveling backwards in time may be proof of antimatter.

Interviewed experts: Beatrice de Gelder, David Chalmers, Roger D. Nelson, Rupert Sheldrake, Michael Persinger, Michio Kaku, Dean Radin, Daryl Bem.

146"Are There Parallel Universes?"Unaired
  Hubble's law illustrated pictorially.In the 1920s, Edwin Hubble found that galaxies are flying away from us at increasing speeds.
Standford's particle accelator has been used to create miniature versions of the Big Bang; B mesons and anti-B mesons were collided by experimenters.
In May 2011, Space Shuttle Endeavour delivered a giant particle detector called "AMS" to the International Space Station. The AMS will look for cosmic rays created billions of years ago from matter and anti-matter annihilating each other in the aftermath of the Big Bang.

Interviewed experts: Max Tegmark, Andrew N. Cleland, JoAnne L. Hewett, Andrei Linde, Paul Steinhardt, Nikodem Popławski.

157"How Does the Universe Work?"July 13, 2011 (2011-07-13)
It was Einstein's famous unfinished project - to find one law that unites all of physics, and explain everything in the universe. It's still an unfinished project, and today hundreds of physicists from CERN to NASA to the Ivory Towers around the world are struggling to find this holy grail of science. 
When the Earth is closer to the Sun on January 4th, the rate of radioactive decay is faster.
The pilot wave theory states that an electron is both a wave and a particle all of the times--not just when it is being observed.
Freeman states that we can see is approximately 5 % of all the matter, dark matter accounts for another 23%, and lastly, dark energy accounts for the remaining 72% of all matter. At the time of this documentary in 2011, Clare Burrage was thinking that dark energy is a by-product of the chameleon particle.[21]

Interviewed experts: Jere Jenkins, Ephraim Fischbach, Anton Zeilinger, Yves Couder, Antony Valentini, Petr Hořava (theorist), Clare Burrage, Max Tegmark.

168"Can We Travel Faster Than Light?"July 20, 2011 (2011-07-20)
Negative energy needed to travel faster than light in the speculative idea of the Alcubierre warp drive is "something that many scientists aren't even sure exists," narrates Freeman. 
Freeman says a wormhole is a "rip in the fabric of space itself." However, wormholes may be a sci-fi fantasy. Leaving aside the huge quantities of the "exotic matter" of negative energy needed, Stephen Hsu has mathematically shown that any quantity of negative energy would be unstable and dangerous.
Spectral lines function similar to bar codes in helping us identify the composition of a star based on the light emitted by the star being studied. The Keck Telescope in Hawaii is used to look at the stars in the northern sky.
João Magueijo states that a variable speed of light can solve the homogeneity problem [that matter looks spread out evenly throughout the universe]; others believe cosmic inflation provides the answer. Cosmic strings are proposed pathways where the speed of light may be faster.

Interviewed experts: Sean M. Carroll, Miguel Alcubierre, Steve Lamoreaux, Stephen Hsu, Christopher Monroe, Steven Olmschenk, John Webb of the University of New South Wales in Sydney,[22] João Magueijo.

179"Can We Live Forever?"July 27, 2011 (2011-07-27)
Mitochondria function like engines in our bodies because they produce energy. Valter Longo at USC has extended the life of a yeast culture from 6 days to 11 weeks by removing the Ras2 and SCH9 genes.
Aubrey de Gray believes that the accumulation of "garbage" in the lysosome of the cell causes aging. Greg Fahy has tried to preserve a rabbit kidney by freezing it. Short of preserving the whole human body, Olaf Sporns has worked to map the human brain in what he calls the connectome using diffusion imaging.
In 1970, John Conway attempts to create an artificial life form (a computer program) that can "live" forever known as the "Game of Life". Instead of transistors, "quantum devices compute with individual atoms." Freeman goes on to state that perhaps humans will give up on human biological immortality but focus on "eternal artificial life."
Clock of the Long Now is designed to last for 10,000 years.

Interviewed experts: Michio Kaku, Valter Longo, Aubrey de Grey, Christopher Voigt, Greg Fahy, Olaf Sporns, Vlatko Vedral, Frank J. Tipler.

1810"What Do Aliens Look Like?"August 3, 2011 (2011-08-03)
In 2009, NASA launched the Kepler space telescope (which has been de-activated in 2018); its mission was to detect the changes in the brightness of distant stars 3,000 light-years away from us. Freeman narrates (that as of 2011) around 300 Earth-like rocky planets orbiting distant non-Sun stars have been discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope.
Sara Seager and William Bains have been studying the exoplanet GJ 1214b, a planet more than 40 light-years away, twice the size of the Earth, and signs of an atmosphere.
Gliese 581d is about 20 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Libra; this planet might harbor "alien life." Its red star Gliese 581 generates half the heat of Earth's Sun.
In 2008, NASA's EPOXI probe sent back images of Earth as our planets would appear to undiscovered alien astronomers. An astro-comb used to reduce "camera shake" to better see planets and stars many light-years away from the Earth.

Interviewed experts: Andrew H. Knoll, Michael LaBarbera of the University of Chicago, Dimitar Sasselov, Diana Valencia, Sara Seager, Seth Shostak of SETI Institute.

Mankind longs for proof that we are not alone in the universe, but the moment of first contact will certainly mean the end of the world as we know it. Whether that is a bad thing for humanity or the start of a great future is uncertain.
Michio Kaku says,"Electromagnetic radiation is the fastest, most effective way to communicate between stars."
An ion engine is based on the repulsion of like charges to create thrust; the Dawn spacecraft was launched by NASA using the principle of ion thruster. The closest star (other than the Sun), Proxima Centauri, is about 25 trillion miles away.

An underlying feature of life is metabolism which is using energy to drive the system.
According to Stephon Alexander, there was a previous universe which collapsed and then bounced out into a revived universe; this Big Bounce is part of a never-ending cycle of contraction and expansion. In 2012, Alexander stated that a neutrino can have a repulsive force that prevents crunching into a singularity.
The existence of animals and plants is because of a fine-tuned universe. Lee Smolin proposed cosmological natural selection as the answer for how the universe is fine-tuned to accommodate the life of humans.

Examining the 2012 discovery of a subatomic particle believed to be the Higgs boson, or "God particle," which could explain how matter came to exist in the universe. Scientists explore the fundamental nature of the Higgs boson and how it gives mass to matter.
Morgan Freeman explains that there are two basic types of elementary particles: (1) fermions which are "a group of massive particles that carry matter," and (2) bosons which are "massless particles that carry force." The commentators explain that the Higgs field converts massless into massive particles.
The LHC in Geneva, Switzerland is 17 miles long. Particle are accelerated LHC. Next, more massive particles are created as a result of the collision of smaller particles.
Freeman explains, "The protons that are smashed together at the LHC...are filled with particles called quarks and gluons." When protons collide, thousands of new particles fly off. The smaller-than-proton particles that shoot out of the collision are like "shattered glass." In the aftermath of proton collisions, physicists at the LHC found Higgs bosons in July 2012.
Freeman elaborates that the Higgs boson doesn't help us understand "dark matter." Afterwards, he discusses the "hierarchy problem" in relation to the Higgs boson.
Freeman says that the W and Z bosons are "extremely heavy."
Francesco Sannino and his colleague believe that the Higgs boson is governed by something even more fundamental which they call the "technicolor force".
Ordinary quarks (a type of fermion) in different arrangements make either protons or neutron depending on the arrangement.
