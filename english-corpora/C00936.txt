Computers have often been used as fictional objects in literature, movies and in other forms of media. Fictional computers tend to be considerably more sophisticated than anything yet devised in the real world.
This is a list of computers that have appeared in notable works of fiction. The work may be about the computer, or the computer may be an important element of the story. Only static computers are included. Robots and other fictional computers that are described as existing in a mobile or humanlike form are discussed in a separate list of fictional robots and androids.

Star Trek â was the first program to predict computers used extensively in everyday life, from large computers used to maintain the starship's varied systems to hand-held devices used for analysis.  The show frequently dealt with the question of when a computer had too much control over people or people became too dependent upon computers.  This often involved the computer becoming an artificial intelligence making decisions beyond people's control.
Ship's Computer (voiced by Majel Barrett), the unnamed Duotronic computer of the Starship Enterprise (1966-1974) - A standard functioning computer except in the episodes "Tomorrow Is Yesterday" (1967) when the computer had been imbued with a female personality which didn't always give desired responses and "The Practical Joker" (1974) when an energy field affected the computer and it began disrupting ships systems to elicit responses from the crew.
The episode The Menagerie (1966) explored the idea that in the future a computer could be used to impersonate a person. It also was used to control the basic helm functions of the starship.  Similarly Court-Martial (1967) introduced the idea that a computer recording could be tampered with to make people believe an event transpired differently.

The crew later returned in "Once Upon a Planet" (1973) whereupon the caretaker of the planet had died and the computer took over with ambitions to escape and explore the universe.
Landru, from the episode "The Return of the Archons" (1967) - Introduced the idea of an independent artificial intelligence which directed the populace and could control them when its ideals were threatened.
Eminiar and Vendikar, from "A Taste of Armageddon" (1967), - A war simulation computer between two planets which determined the casualties of "battles".
The Guardian of Forever, from "The City on the Edge of Forever" (1967) - A mysterious being/device which provided a portal through time and space.
Nomad, from "The Changeling" (1967) - A hybrid of two damaged probes which repaired each-other by combining their parts as well as their programmed instructions creating a new directive.
Vaal, from the episode "The Apple" (1967) - A computer which protected a population by controlling their understanding and presenting itself as their god. It also could control the weather and affect starships in orbit.
"The Doomsday Machine", from the episode of the same name (1967) - An automated machine that sought out planets to destroy and would retaliate against attackers.
M-4, from "Requiem for Methuselah" (1969) â A mobile computer created by Mr. Flint to protect him, his home, and his ward, Rayna.[12]
M-5, from "The Ultimate Computer" (1968) (voiced by James Doohan) - An experimental computer designed to replace a starship's main duotronic computer and automate most shipboard functions as well as obsolete most of its crew.
Beta 5, from "Assignment: Earth" (1968) (voiced by Barbara Babcock) - The main database of pseudo-secret agent Gary Seven which seemed capable of independent thought and responses but remained loyal to its programmers.
The Controller, from Spock's Brain (1968) - A computer needing a living brain to operate which controlled a vast database and decided who could access it.  It also controlled life support systems for its occupants.
The Oracle, from "For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky" (1968) (voiced by James Doohan) - A society-directing computer designed to be the god of its people and operator of the spacecraft they inhabited.
The Kalandan computer, from That Which Survives (1968) creates a defense system utilizing the personality and image of its last recorded message.
Memory Alpha, from The Lights of Zetar (1969) - A facility containing all the accumulated knowledge of The United Federation of Planets.
The Atavachron, from "All Our Yesterdays" (1969) - controlled navigation of a time portal and also prepared the travelers bodies for the transition.
V'Ger from The Motion Picture (1979) was originally the NASA Voyager 6 probe which was found by a computerized planet and upgraded with alien technology to fulfill its simple programming of "learn all that is learnable and return that information to its creator."  V'Ger amassed so much knowledge that it attained consciousness and when joined with living beings' minds which could accept things beyond logic, evolved to a higher plane of consciousness.

Most other pieces of the machine, which are sparse around half of the bedroom of its creator, were chosen (or modified) to have the most generic look and avoid explicit connection to specific brands.
