In mathematics, an inner product space (or, rarely, a Hausdorff pre-Hilbert space) is a real vector space or a complex vector space with an operation called an inner product.  The inner product of two vectors in the space is a scalar, often denoted with angle brackets such as in                     ⟨        a        ,        b        ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle a,b\rangle }  . Inner products allow formal definitions of intuitive geometric notions, such as lengths, angles, and orthogonality (zero inner product) of vectors. Inner product spaces generalize Euclidean vector spaces, in which the inner product is the dot product or scalar product of Cartesian coordinates. Inner product spaces of infinite dimension are widely used in functional analysis. Inner product spaces over the field of complex numbers are sometimes referred to as unitary spaces. The first usage of the concept of a vector space with an inner product is due to Giuseppe Peano, in 1898.An inner product naturally induces an associated norm, (denoted                               |                x                  |                      {\displaystyle |x|}   and                               |                y                  |                      {\displaystyle |y|}   in the picture); so, every inner product space is a normed vector space. If this normed space is also complete (that is, a Banach space) then the inner product space is a Hilbert space. If an inner product space H is not a Hilbert space, it can be extended by completion to a Hilbert space                                           H            ¯                          .              {\displaystyle {\overline {H}}.}   This means that                     H              {\displaystyle H}   is a linear subspace of                                           H            ¯                          ,              {\displaystyle {\overline {H}},}   the inner product of                     H              {\displaystyle H}   is the restriction of that of                                           H            ¯                          ,              {\displaystyle {\overline {H}},}   and                     H              {\displaystyle H}   is dense in                                           H            ¯                                {\displaystyle {\overline {H}}}   for the topology defined by the norm. Definition In this article, F denotes a field that is either the real numbers                               R                ,              {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ,}   or the complex numbers                               C                .              {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} .}   A scalar is thus an element of F. A bar over an expression representing a scalar denotes the complex conjugate of this scalar. A zero vector is denoted                               0                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {0} }   for distinguishing it from the scalar 0.An inner product space is a vector space V over the field F together with an inner product, that is a map                    ⟨        ⋅        ,        ⋅        ⟩        :        V        ×        V        →        F              {\displaystyle \langle \cdot ,\cdot \rangle :V\times V\to F}  that satisfies the following three properties for all vectors                     x        ,        y        ,        z        ∈        V              {\displaystyle x,y,z\in V}   and all scalars                     a        ,        b        ∈        F              {\displaystyle a,b\in F}  .Conjugate symmetry:  As                     x        =                              x            ¯                                {\textstyle x={\overline {x}}}   if and only if x is real, conjugate symmetry implies that                     ⟨        x        ,        x        ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle }   is always a real number. If F is                               R                      {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }  , conjugate symmetry is just symmetry.Linearity in the first argument:Positive-definiteness: if x is not zero, then  (conjugate symmetry implies that                     ⟨        x        ,        x        ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle }   is real).If the positive-definiteness condition is replaced by merely requiring that                     ⟨        x        ,        x        ⟩        ≥        0              {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle \geq 0}   for all x, then one obtains the definition of positive semi-definite Hermitian form.

Hence an inner product on a real vector space is a positive-definite symmetric bilinear form. The binomial expansion of a square becomes                    ⟨        x        +        y        ,        x        +        y        ⟩        =        ⟨        x        ,        x        ⟩        +        2        ⟨        x        ,        y        ⟩        +        ⟨        y        ,        y        ⟩        .              {\displaystyle \langle x+y,x+y\rangle =\langle x,x\rangle +2\langle x,y\rangle +\langle y,y\rangle .}  = Convention variant =Some authors, especially in physics and matrix algebra, prefer to define inner products and sesquilinear forms with linearity in the second argument rather than the first. Then the first argument becomes conjugate linear, rather than the second.

It is a weighted-sum version of the dot product with positive weights—up to an orthogonal transformation.= Hilbert space =The article on Hilbert spaces has several examples of inner product spaces, wherein the metric induced by the inner product yields a complete metric space. An example of an inner product space which induces an incomplete metric is the space                     C        (        [        a        ,        b        ]        )              {\displaystyle C([a,b])}   of continuous complex valued functions                     f              {\displaystyle f}   and                     g              {\displaystyle g}   on the interval                     [        a        ,        b        ]        .              {\displaystyle [a,b].}   The inner product isThis space is not complete; consider for example, for the interval [−1, 1] the sequence of continuous "step" functions,                     {                  f                      k                                    }                      k                          ,              {\displaystyle \{f_{k}\}_{k},}   defined by:This sequence is a Cauchy sequence for the norm induced by the preceding inner product, which does not converge to a continuous function.= Random variables =For real random variables                     X              {\displaystyle X}   and                     Y        ,              {\displaystyle Y,}   the expected value of their productis an inner product. In this case,                     ⟨        X        ,        X        ⟩        =        0              {\displaystyle \langle X,X\rangle =0}   if and only if                     Pr        (        X        =        0        )        =        1              {\displaystyle \Pr(X=0)=1}   (that is,                     X        =        0              {\displaystyle X=0}   almost surely), where                     Pr              {\displaystyle \Pr }   denotes the probability of the event. This definition of expectation as inner product can be extended to random vectors as well.= Complex matrices =The inner product for complex square matrices of the same size is the Frobenius inner product                     ⟨        A        ,        B        ⟩        :=        tr        ⁡                  (                      A                          B                                                H                                                              )                      {\displaystyle \langle A,B\rangle :=\operatorname {tr} \left(AB^{\textsf {H}}\right)}  . Since trace and transposition are linear and the conjugation is on the second matrix, it is a sesquilinear operator. We further get Hermitian symmetry by, Finally, since for                     A              {\displaystyle A}   nonzero,                     ⟨        A        ,        A        ⟩        =                  ∑                      i            j                                                |                          A                              i                j                                      |                                2                          >        0              {\displaystyle \langle A,A\rangle =\sum _{ij}\left|A_{ij}\right|^{2}>0}  , we get that the Frobenius inner product is positive definite too, and so is an inner product.= Vector spaces with forms =On an inner product space, or more generally a vector space with a nondegenerate form (hence an isomorphism                     V        →                  V                      ∗                                {\displaystyle V\to V^{*}}  ), vectors can be sent to covectors (in coordinates, via transpose), so that one can take the inner product and outer product of two vectors—not simply of a vector and a covector. Basic results, terminology, and definitions = Norm properties =Every inner product space induces a norm, called its canonical norm, that is defined by With this norm, every inner product space becomes a normed vector space. So, every general property of normed vector spaces applies to inner product spaces. In particular, one has the following properties:Absolute homogeneityfor every                     x        ∈        V              {\displaystyle x\in V}   and                     a        ∈        F              {\displaystyle a\in F}  (this results from                     ⟨        a        x        ,        a        x        ⟩        =        a                              a            ¯                          ⟨        x        ,        x        ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle ax,ax\rangle =a{\overline {a}}\langle x,x\rangle }  ).Triangle inequalityfor                     x        ,        y        ∈        V        .              {\displaystyle x,y\in V.}  These two properties show that one has indeed a norm.Cauchy–Schwarz inequalityfor every                     x        ,        y        ∈        V        ,              {\displaystyle x,y\in V,}  with equality if and only if                     x              {\displaystyle x}   and                     y              {\displaystyle y}   are linearly dependent.Parallelogram lawfor every                     x        ,        y        ∈        V        .              {\displaystyle x,y\in V.}  The parallelogram law is a necessary and sufficient condition for a norm to be defined by an inner product.Polarization identityfor every                     x        ,        y        ∈        V        .              {\displaystyle x,y\in V.}  The inner product can be retrieved from the norm by the polarization identity, since its imaginary part is the real part of                     ⟨        x        ,        i        y        ⟩        .              {\displaystyle \langle x,iy\rangle .}  Ptolemy's inequalityfor every                     x        ,        y        ,        z        ∈        V        .              {\displaystyle x,y,z\in V.}  Ptolemy's inequality is a necessary and sufficient condition for a seminorm to be the norm defined by an inner product.= Orthogonality =OrthogonalityTwo vectors                     x              {\displaystyle x}   and                     y              {\displaystyle y}   are said to be orthogonal, often written                     x        ⊥        y        ,              {\displaystyle x\perp y,}   if their inner product is zero, that is, if                     ⟨        x        ,        y        ⟩        =        0.              {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle =0.}   This happens if and only if                     ‖        x        ‖        ≤        ‖        x        +        s        y        ‖              {\displaystyle \|x\|\leq \|x+sy\|}   for all scalars                     s        ,              {\displaystyle s,}   and if and only if the real-valued function                     f        (        s        )        :=        ‖        x        +        s        y                  ‖                      2                          −        ‖        x                  ‖                      2                                {\displaystyle f(s):=\|x+sy\|^{2}-\|x\|^{2}}   is non-negative.

Also, had                     ⟨        x        ,        y        ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle }   been instead defined to be the symmetric map                     ⟨        x        ,        y        ⟩        =        x        y              {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle =xy}    (rather than the usual conjugate symmetric map                     ⟨        x        ,        y        ⟩        =        x                              y            ¯                                {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle =x{\overline {y}}}  ) then its real part                     ⟨        x        ,        y                  ⟩                                    R                                            {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle _{\mathbb {R} }}   would not be the dot product; furthermore, without the complex conjugate, if                     x        ∈                  C                      {\displaystyle x\in \mathbb {C} }   but                     x        ∉                  R                      {\displaystyle x\not \in \mathbb {R} }   then                     ⟨        x        ,        x        ⟩        =        x        x        =                  x                      2                          ∉        [        0        ,        ∞        )              {\displaystyle \langle x,x\rangle =xx=x^{2}\not \in [0,\infty )}   so the assignment                     x        ↦                              ⟨            x            ,            x            ⟩                                {\displaystyle x\mapsto {\sqrt {\langle x,x\rangle }}}   would not define a norm.The next examples show that although real and complex inner products have many properties and results in common, they are not entirely interchangeable.For instance, if                     ⟨        x        ,        y        ⟩        =        0              {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle =0}   then                     ⟨        x        ,        y                  ⟩                                    R                                      =        0        ,              {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle _{\mathbb {R} }=0,}   but the next example shows that the converse is in general not true.Given any                     x        ∈        V        ,              {\displaystyle x\in V,}   the vector                     i        x              {\displaystyle ix}   (which is the vector                     x              {\displaystyle x}   rotated by 90°) belongs to                     V              {\displaystyle V}   and so also belongs to                               V                                    R                                            {\displaystyle V_{\mathbb {R} }}   (although scalar multiplication of                     x              {\displaystyle x}   by                     i        =                              −            1                                {\displaystyle i={\sqrt {-1}}}   is not defined in                               V                                    R                                      ,              {\displaystyle V_{\mathbb {R} },}   the vector in                     V              {\displaystyle V}   denoted by                     i        x              {\displaystyle ix}   is nevertheless still also an element of                               V                                    R                                            {\displaystyle V_{\mathbb {R} }}  ). For the complex inner product,                     ⟨        x        ,        i        x        ⟩        =        −        i        ‖        x                  ‖                      2                          ,              {\displaystyle \langle x,ix\rangle =-i\|x\|^{2},}   whereas for the real inner product the value is always                     ⟨        x        ,        i        x                  ⟩                                    R                                      =        0.              {\displaystyle \langle x,ix\rangle _{\mathbb {R} }=0.}  If                     ⟨                ⋅        ,        ⋅                ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle \,\cdot ,\cdot \,\rangle }   is a complex inner product and                     A        :        V        →        V              {\displaystyle A:V\to V}   is a continuous linear operator that satisfies                     ⟨        x        ,        A        x        ⟩        =        0              {\displaystyle \langle x,Ax\rangle =0}   for all                     x        ∈        V        ,              {\displaystyle x\in V,}   then                     A        =        0.              {\displaystyle A=0.}   This statement is no longer true if                     ⟨                ⋅        ,        ⋅                ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle \,\cdot ,\cdot \,\rangle }   is instead a real inner product, as this next example shows. Suppose that                     V        =                  C                      {\displaystyle V=\mathbb {C} }   has the inner product                     ⟨        x        ,        y        ⟩        :=        x                              y            ¯                                {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle :=x{\overline {y}}}   mentioned above. Then the map                     A        :        V        →        V              {\displaystyle A:V\to V}   defined by                     A        x        =        i        x              {\displaystyle Ax=ix}   is a linear map (linear for both                     V              {\displaystyle V}   and                               V                                    R                                            {\displaystyle V_{\mathbb {R} }}  ) that denotes rotation by                               90                      ∘                                {\displaystyle 90^{\circ }}   in the plane. Because                     x              {\displaystyle x}   and                     A        x              {\displaystyle Ax}   perpendicular vectors and                     ⟨        x        ,        A        x                  ⟩                                    R                                            {\displaystyle \langle x,Ax\rangle _{\mathbb {R} }}   is just the dot product,                     ⟨        x        ,        A        x                  ⟩                                    R                                      =        0              {\displaystyle \langle x,Ax\rangle _{\mathbb {R} }=0}   for all vectors                     x        ;              {\displaystyle x;}   nevertheless, this rotation map                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is certainly not identically                     0.              {\displaystyle 0.}   In contrast, using the complex inner product gives                     ⟨        x        ,        A        x        ⟩        =        −        i        ‖        x                  ‖                      2                          ,              {\displaystyle \langle x,Ax\rangle =-i\|x\|^{2},}   which (as expected) is not identically zero. Orthonormal sequences Let                     V              {\displaystyle V}   be a finite dimensional inner product space of dimension                     n        .              {\displaystyle n.}   Recall that every basis of                     V              {\displaystyle V}   consists of exactly                     n              {\displaystyle n}   linearly independent vectors. Using the Gram–Schmidt process we may start with an arbitrary basis and transform it into an orthonormal basis. That is, into a basis in which all the elements are orthogonal and have unit norm. In symbols, a basis                     {                  e                      1                          ,        …        ,                  e                      n                          }              {\displaystyle \{e_{1},\ldots ,e_{n}\}}   is orthonormal if                     ⟨                  e                      i                          ,                  e                      j                          ⟩        =        0              {\displaystyle \langle e_{i},e_{j}\rangle =0}   for every                     i        ≠        j              {\displaystyle i\neq j}   and                     ⟨                  e                      i                          ,                  e                      i                          ⟩        =        ‖                  e                      a                                    ‖                      2                          =        1              {\displaystyle \langle e_{i},e_{i}\rangle =\|e_{a}\|^{2}=1}   for each index                     i        .              {\displaystyle i.}  This definition of orthonormal basis generalizes to the case of infinite-dimensional inner product spaces in the following way. Let                     V              {\displaystyle V}   be any inner product space. Then a collectionis a basis for                     V              {\displaystyle V}   if the subspace of                     V              {\displaystyle V}   generated by finite linear combinations of elements of                     E              {\displaystyle E}   is dense in                     V              {\displaystyle V}   (in the norm induced by the inner product). Say that                     E              {\displaystyle E}   is an orthonormal basis for                     V              {\displaystyle V}   if it is a basis andif                     a        ≠        b              {\displaystyle a\neq b}   and                     ⟨                  e                      a                          ,                  e                      a                          ⟩        =        ‖                  e                      a                                    ‖                      2                          =        1              {\displaystyle \langle e_{a},e_{a}\rangle =\|e_{a}\|^{2}=1}   for all                     a        ,        b        ∈        A        .              {\displaystyle a,b\in A.}  Using an infinite-dimensional analog of the Gram-Schmidt process one may show:Theorem. Any separable inner product space has an orthonormal basis.Using the Hausdorff maximal principle and the fact that in a complete inner product space orthogonal projection onto linear subspaces is well-defined, one may also show thatTheorem. Any complete inner product space has an orthonormal basis.The two previous theorems raise the question of whether all inner product spaces have an orthonormal basis. The answer, it turns out is negative. This is a non-trivial result, and is proved below. The following proof is taken from Halmos's A Hilbert Space Problem Book (see the references).Parseval's identity leads immediately to the following theorem:Theorem. Let                     V              {\displaystyle V}   be a separable inner product space and                                           {                          e                              k                                      }                                k                                {\displaystyle \left\{e_{k}\right\}_{k}}   an orthonormal basis of                     V        .              {\displaystyle V.}   Then the mapis an isometric linear map                     V        ↦                  ℓ                      2                                {\displaystyle V\mapsto \ell ^{2}}   with a dense image.This theorem can be regarded as an abstract form of Fourier series, in which an arbitrary orthonormal basis plays the role of the sequence of trigonometric polynomials. Note that the underlying index set can be taken to be any countable set (and in fact any set whatsoever, provided                               ℓ                      2                                {\displaystyle \ell ^{2}}   is defined appropriately, as is explained in the article Hilbert space). In particular, we obtain the following result in the theory of Fourier series:Theorem. Let                     V              {\displaystyle V}   be the inner product space                     C        [        −        π        ,        π        ]        .              {\displaystyle C[-\pi ,\pi ].}   Then the sequence (indexed on set of all integers) of continuous functionsis an orthonormal basis of the space                     C        [        −        π        ,        π        ]              {\displaystyle C[-\pi ,\pi ]}   with the                               L                      2                                {\displaystyle L^{2}}   inner product. The mappingis an isometric linear map with dense image.Orthogonality of the sequence                     {                  e                      k                                    }                      k                                {\displaystyle \{e_{k}\}_{k}}   follows immediately from the fact that if                     k        ≠        j        ,              {\displaystyle k\neq j,}   thenNormality of the sequence is by design, that is, the coefficients are so chosen so that the norm comes out to 1. Finally the fact that the sequence has a dense algebraic span, in the inner product norm, follows from the fact that the sequence has a dense algebraic span, this time in the space of continuous periodic functions on                     [        −        π        ,        π        ]              {\displaystyle [-\pi ,\pi ]}   with the uniform norm. This is the content of the Weierstrass theorem on the uniform density of trigonometric polynomials. Operators on inner product spaces Several types of linear maps                     A        :        V        →        W              {\displaystyle A:V\to W}   between inner product spaces                     V              {\displaystyle V}   and                     W              {\displaystyle W}   are of relevance:Continuous linear maps:                     A        :        V        →        W              {\displaystyle A:V\to W}   is linear and continuous with respect to the metric defined above, or equivalently,                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is linear and the set of non-negative reals                     {        ‖        A        x        ‖        :        ‖        x        ‖        ≤        1        }        ,              {\displaystyle \{\|Ax\|:\|x\|\leq 1\},}   where                     x              {\displaystyle x}   ranges over the closed unit ball of                     V        ,              {\displaystyle V,}   is bounded.Symmetric linear operators:                     A        :        V        →        W              {\displaystyle A:V\to W}   is linear and                     ⟨        A        x        ,        y        ⟩        =        ⟨        x        ,        A        y        ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle Ax,y\rangle =\langle x,Ay\rangle }   for all                     x        ,        y        ∈        V        .              {\displaystyle x,y\in V.}  Isometries:                     A        :        V        →        W              {\displaystyle A:V\to W}   satisfies                     ‖        A        x        ‖        =        ‖        x        ‖              {\displaystyle \|Ax\|=\|x\|}   for all                     x        ∈        V        .              {\displaystyle x\in V.}   A linear isometry (resp. an antilinear isometry) is an isometry that is also a linear map (resp. an antilinear map). For inner product spaces, the polarization identity can be used to show that                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is an isometry if and only if                     ⟨        A        x        ,        A        y        ⟩        =        ⟨        x        ,        y        ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle Ax,Ay\rangle =\langle x,y\rangle }   for all                     x        ,        y        ∈        V        .              {\displaystyle x,y\in V.}    All isometries are injective. The Mazur–Ulam theorem establishes that every surjective isometry between two real normed spaces is an affine transformation. Consequently, an isometry                     A              {\displaystyle A}   between real inner product spaces is a linear map if and only if                     A        (        0        )        =        0.              {\displaystyle A(0)=0.}   Isometries are morphisms between inner product spaces, and morphisms of real inner product spaces are orthogonal transformations (compare with orthogonal matrix).Isometrical isomorphisms:                     A        :        V        →        W              {\displaystyle A:V\to W}   is an isometry which is surjective (and hence bijective). Isometrical isomorphisms are also known as unitary operators (compare with unitary matrix).From the point of view of inner product space theory, there is no need to distinguish between two spaces which are isometrically isomorphic. The spectral theorem provides a canonical form for symmetric, unitary and more generally normal operators on finite dimensional inner product spaces. A generalization of the spectral theorem holds for continuous normal operators in Hilbert spaces. Generalizations Any of the axioms of an inner product may be weakened, yielding generalized notions. The generalizations that are closest to inner products occur where bilinearity and conjugate symmetry are retained, but positive-definiteness is weakened.= Degenerate inner products =If                     V              {\displaystyle V}   is a vector space and                     ⟨                ⋅                ,                ⋅                ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle \,\cdot \,,\,\cdot \,\rangle }   a semi-definite sesquilinear form, then the function:makes sense and satisfies all the properties of norm except that                     ‖        x        ‖        =        0              {\displaystyle \|x\|=0}   does not imply                     x        =        0              {\displaystyle x=0}   (such a functional is then called a semi-norm). We can produce an inner product space by considering the quotient                     W        =        V                  /                {        x        :        ‖        x        ‖        =        0        }        .              {\displaystyle W=V/\{x:\|x\|=0\}.}   The sesquilinear form                     ⟨                ⋅                ,                ⋅                ⟩              {\displaystyle \langle \,\cdot \,,\,\cdot \,\rangle }   factors through                     W        .              {\displaystyle W.}  This construction is used in numerous contexts. The Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction is a particularly important example of the use of this technique. Another example is the representation of semi-definite kernels on arbitrary sets.= Nondegenerate conjugate symmetric forms =Alternatively, one may require that the pairing be a nondegenerate form, meaning that for all non-zero                     x        ≠        0              {\displaystyle x\neq 0}   there exists some                     y              {\displaystyle y}   such that                     ⟨        x        ,        y        ⟩        ≠        0        ,              {\displaystyle \langle x,y\rangle \neq 0,}   though                     y              {\displaystyle y}   need not equal                     x              {\displaystyle x}  ; in other words, the induced map to the dual space                     V        →                  V                      ∗                                {\displaystyle V\to V^{*}}   is injective. This generalization is important in differential geometry: a manifold whose tangent spaces have an inner product is a Riemannian manifold, while if this is related to nondegenerate conjugate symmetric form the manifold is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. By Sylvester's law of inertia, just as every inner product is similar to the dot product with positive weights on a set of vectors, every nondegenerate conjugate symmetric form is similar to the dot product with nonzero weights on a set of vectors, and the number of positive and negative weights are called respectively the positive index and negative index. Product of vectors in Minkowski space is an example of indefinite inner product, although, technically speaking, it is not an inner product according to the standard definition above. Minkowski space has four dimensions and indices 3 and 1 (assignment of "+" and "−" to them differs depending on conventions).Purely algebraic statements (ones that do not use positivity) usually only rely on the nondegeneracy (the injective homomorphism                     V        →                  V                      ∗                                {\displaystyle V\to V^{*}}  ) and thus hold more generally. Related products The term "inner product" is opposed to outer product, which is a slightly more general opposite. Simply, in coordinates, the inner product is the product of a                     1        ×        n              {\displaystyle 1\times n}   covector with an                     n        ×        1              {\displaystyle n\times 1}   vector, yielding a                     1        ×        1              {\displaystyle 1\times 1}   matrix (a scalar), while the outer product is the product of an                     m        ×        1              {\displaystyle m\times 1}   vector with a                     1        ×        n              {\displaystyle 1\times n}   covector, yielding an                     m        ×        n              {\displaystyle m\times n}   matrix. The outer product is defined for different dimensions, while the inner product requires the same dimension. If the dimensions are the same, then the inner product is the trace of the outer product (trace only being properly defined for square matrices). In an informal summary: "inner is horizontal times vertical and shrinks down, outer is vertical times horizontal and expands out".More abstractly, the outer product is the bilinear map                     W        ×                  V                      ∗                          →        hom        ⁡        (        V        ,        W        )              {\displaystyle W\times V^{*}\to \hom(V,W)}   sending a vector and a covector to a rank 1 linear transformation (simple tensor of type (1, 1)), while the inner product is the bilinear evaluation map                               V                      ∗                          ×        V        →        F              {\displaystyle V^{*}\times V\to F}   given by evaluating a covector on a vector; the order of the domain vector spaces here reflects the covector/vector distinction.The inner product and outer product should not be confused with the interior product and exterior product, which are instead operations on vector fields and differential forms, or more generally on the exterior algebra.As a further complication, in geometric algebra the inner product and the exterior (Grassmann) product are combined in the geometric product (the Clifford product in a Clifford algebra) – the inner product sends two vectors (1-vectors) to a scalar (a 0-vector), while the exterior product sends two vectors to a bivector (2-vector) – and in this context the exterior product is usually called the outer product (alternatively, wedge product). The inner product is more correctly called a scalar product in this context, as the nondegenerate quadratic form in question need not be positive definite (need not be an inner product).
