== History ==
PK-35 was founded in Vyborg in 1935. After the Finnish Winter War and Second World War, PK-35 was refounded in Helsinki in 1948. When PK-35 was coached by Pasi Rautiainen in the mid-1990s they were promoted to Finland's top division, the Veikkausliiga. After some economic troubles, the club's top representative team was acquired by Hjallis Harkimo and renamed FC Jokerit. The PK-35 club, however, continued with the other teams in lower divisions using its original name. PK-35 was promoted to Kakkonen in 2001 and to Ykkönen in 2005.


=== Move to Vantaa ===
After the 2008 season Pallokerho-35 decided to move its men's and women's first teams to the commuter town of Vantaa, where they played at ISS Stadion in Myyrmäki. The teams were run by a newly created association and competed with the name PK-35 Vantaa. Pallokerho-35 and its other teams (juniors) stayed in Helsinki under the association PK-35 ry (main club).


=== Bankruptcy ===
The club suffered serious financial problems in its final years. Sitting bottom of the 2016 Veikkausliiga, the club were docked 6 points and manager Shefki Kuqi left to join Inter Turku.The club was relegated at the end of the season but did not apply for a licence to play in the 2017 Ykkönen and ceased operations. The club's name continues however as the club which split from the PK-35 organisation when it was renamed FC Jokerit still play in the Helsinki area Kolmonen division (4th tier).
