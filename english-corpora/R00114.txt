== Grenfell Tower fire public inquiry ==

It was announced on 29 June 2017 that Moore-Bick would lead a public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire. On 29 and 30 June it was widely reported that the tenant's solicitor in the case against Westminster City Council had said, after Moore-Bick's ruling, that it gave "the green light for social-cleansing of the poor on a mass scale." The local Labour MP, Emma Dent Coad, said on 4 July that local people have no confidence in Moore-Bick and that he should stand down.On 25 July, at the second public meeting held by the Inquiry before finalisation of its terms of reference, Moore-Bick faced further calls for his resignation, many residents saying that he did not represent them.  In response, Moore-Bick said that he was qualified to lead the investigation, because in his 20 years as a judge, he had looked into "the sort of problems that have to be considered in relation to this fire." He promised that the Inquiry would consider the deregulation of fire safety standards, as well as the multi-million pound refurbishment to Grenfell Tower. "We are going to investigate and find the facts in relation to the whole course of events," he said.The 1,000-page first stage of the report on the Inquiry was formally published on 30 October 2019.
