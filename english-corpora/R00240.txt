[1,1'‑Bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium(II) dichloride is a palladium complex containing the bidentate ligand 1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf), abbreviated as [(dppf)PdCl2]. This commercially available material can be prepared by reacting dppf with a suitable nitrile complex of palladium dichloride:
dppf + PdCl2(RCN)2 → (dppf)PdCl2 + 2 RCN (RCN = CH3CN or C6H5CN)The compound is popularly used for palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions, such as the Buchwald–Hartwig amination and the reductive homocoupling of aryl halides.
