In linear algebra, the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix is a polynomial which is invariant under matrix similarity and has the eigenvalues as roots. It has the determinant and the trace of the matrix among its coefficients. The characteristic polynomial of an endomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix of that endomorphism over any base (that is, the characteristic polynomial does not depend on the choice of a basis). The characteristic equation, also known as the determinantal equation, is the equation obtained by equating the characteristic polynomial to zero.In spectral graph theory, the characteristic polynomial of a graph is the characteristic polynomial of its adjacency matrix. Motivation Given a square matrix                     A        ,              {\displaystyle A,}   we want to find a polynomial whose zeros are the eigenvalues of                     A        .              {\displaystyle A.}    For a diagonal matrix                     A        ,              {\displaystyle A,}   the characteristic polynomial can be defined by: if the diagonal entries are                               a                      1                          ,                  a                      2                          ,                  a                      3                          ,        …        ,              {\displaystyle a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots ,}   etc. then the characteristic polynomial will be:This works because the diagonal entries are also the eigenvalues of this matrix.For a general matrix                     A        ,              {\displaystyle A,}   one can proceed as follows. A scalar                     λ              {\displaystyle \lambda }   is an eigenvalue of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   if and only if there is a nonzero vector                               v                ,              {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ,}   called an eigenvector, such thator, equivalently,where                     I              {\displaystyle I}    is the identity matrix. Since                               v                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }   must be nonzero, this means that the matrix                     λ        I        −        A              {\displaystyle \lambda I-A}   has a nonzero kernel. Thus this matrix is not invertible, and its determinant must therefore be zero. Thus the eigenvalues of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   are the roots of                     det        (        λ        I        −        A        )        ,              {\displaystyle \det(\lambda I-A),}   which is a polynomial in                     λ        .              {\displaystyle \lambda .}   Formal definition Consider an                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}   matrix                     A        .              {\displaystyle A.}   The characteristic polynomial of                     A        ,              {\displaystyle A,}   denoted by                               p                      A                          (        t        )        ,              {\displaystyle p_{A}(t),}   is the polynomial defined bywhere                     I              {\displaystyle I}   denotes the                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}   identity matrix.Some authors define the characteristic polynomial to be                     det        (        A        −        t        I        )        .              {\displaystyle \det(A-tI).}   That polynomial differs from the one defined here by a sign                     (        −        1                  )                      n                          ,              {\displaystyle (-1)^{n},}   so it makes no difference for properties like having as roots the eigenvalues of                     A              {\displaystyle A}  ; however the definition above always gives a monic polynomial, whereas the alternative definition is monic only when                     n              {\displaystyle n}   is even. Examples To compute the characteristic polynomial of the matrixthe determinant of the following is computed: and found to be                     (        t        −        2        )        t        −        1        (        −        1        )        =                  t                      2                          −        2        t        +        1                        ,              {\displaystyle (t-2)t-1(-1)=t^{2}-2t+1\,\!,}   the characteristic polynomial of                     A        .              {\displaystyle A.}  Another example uses hyperbolic functions of a hyperbolic angle φ.For the matrix takeIts characteristic polynomial is Properties The characteristic polynomial                               p                      A                          (        t        )              {\displaystyle p_{A}(t)}   of a                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}   matrix is monic (its leading coefficient is                     1              {\displaystyle 1}  ) and its degree is                     n        .              {\displaystyle n.}    The most important fact about the characteristic polynomial was already mentioned in the motivational paragraph: the eigenvalues of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   are precisely the roots of                               p                      A                          (        t        )              {\displaystyle p_{A}(t)}   (this also holds for the minimal polynomial of                     A        ,              {\displaystyle A,}   but its degree may be less than                     n              {\displaystyle n}  ).  All coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are polynomial expressions in the entries of the matrix.

Informally speaking, every matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. This statement is equivalent to saying that the minimal polynomial of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   divides the characteristic polynomial of                     A        .              {\displaystyle A.}  Two similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.  The converse however is not true in general: two matrices with the same characteristic polynomial need not be similar.The matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}   and its transpose have the same characteristic polynomial.                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is similar to a triangular matrix if and only if its characteristic polynomial can be completely factored into linear factors over                     K              {\displaystyle K}   (the same is true with the minimal polynomial instead of the characteristic polynomial). In this case                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is similar to a matrix in Jordan normal form. Characteristic polynomial of a product of two matrices If                     A              {\displaystyle A}   and                     B              {\displaystyle B}   are two square                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}   matrices then characteristic polynomials of                     A        B              {\displaystyle AB}   and                     B        A              {\displaystyle BA}   coincide: When                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is non-singular this result follows from the fact that                     A        B              {\displaystyle AB}   and                     B        A              {\displaystyle BA}   are similar:For the case where both                     A              {\displaystyle A}   and                     B              {\displaystyle B}   are singular, the desired identity is an equality between polynomials in                     t              {\displaystyle t}   and the coefficients of the matrices. Thus, to prove this equality, it suffices to prove that it is verified on a non-empty open subset (for the usual topology, or, more generally, for the Zariski topology) of the space of all the coefficients. As the non-singular matrices form such an open subset of the space of all matrices, this proves the result.More generally, if                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is a matrix of order                     m        ×        n              {\displaystyle m\times n}   and                     B              {\displaystyle B}   is a matrix of order                     n        ×        m        ,              {\displaystyle n\times m,}   then                     A        B              {\displaystyle AB}   is                     m        ×        m              {\displaystyle m\times m}   and                     B        A              {\displaystyle BA}   is                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}   matrix, and one hasTo prove this, one may suppose                     n        >        m        ,              {\displaystyle n>m,}   by exchanging, if needed,                     A              {\displaystyle A}   and                     B        .              {\displaystyle B.}   Then, by bordering                     A              {\displaystyle A}   on the bottom by                     n        −        m              {\displaystyle n-m}   rows of zeros, and                     B              {\displaystyle B}   on the right, by,                     n        −        m              {\displaystyle n-m}   columns of zeros, one gets two                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}   matrices                               A                      ′                                {\displaystyle A^{\prime }}   and                               B                      ′                                {\displaystyle B^{\prime }}   such that                               B                      ′                                    A                      ′                          =        B        A              {\displaystyle B^{\prime }A^{\prime }=BA}   and                               A                      ′                                    B                      ′                                {\displaystyle A^{\prime }B^{\prime }}   is equal to                     A        B              {\displaystyle AB}   bordered by                     n        −        m              {\displaystyle n-m}   rows and columns of zeros.

Secular function and secular equation = Secular function =The term secular function has been used for what is now called characteristic polynomial (in some literature the term secular function is still used). The term comes from the fact that the characteristic polynomial was used to calculate secular perturbations (on a time scale of a century, that is, slow compared to annual motion) of planetary orbits, according to Lagrange's theory of oscillations.= Secular equation =Secular equation may have several meanings.In linear algebra it is sometimes used in place of characteristic equation.In astronomy it is the algebraic or numerical expression of the magnitude of the inequalities in a planet's motion that remain after the inequalities of a short period have been allowed for.In molecular orbital calculations relating to the energy of the electron and its wave function it is also used instead of the characteristic equation. For general associative algebras The above definition of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix                     A        ∈                  M                      n                          (        F        )              {\displaystyle A\in M_{n}(F)}   with entries in a field                     F              {\displaystyle F}   generalizes without any changes to the case when                     F              {\displaystyle F}   is just a commutative ring. Garibaldi (2004) defines the characteristic polynomial for elements of an arbitrary finite-dimensional (associative, but not necessarily commutative) algebra over a field                     F              {\displaystyle F}   and proves the standard properties of the characteristic polynomial in this generality.
