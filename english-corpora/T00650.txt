Allahabad, also known as Prayagraj, is one of the holiest cities in India, is in Uttar Pradesh. About 80 million people are expected to visit the Kumbh Mela - a Hindu pilgrimage in Allahabad.


Understand[edit]  New Yamuna bridge, AllahabadAllahabad is among the largest cities in Uttar Pradesh. Hindu mythology has it that for the Prakrishta Yajna, Lord Brahma, the creator God of the Hindu Trinity, chose a land on earth, on which the three rivers would flow in to a quiet confluence. Brahma also referred to it as Tirth Raj or the King of all pilgrimage centres. Recorded evidence also exists in the Hindu scriptures (the Vedas and the grand epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, as also in the Puranas) of this holy place formerly called Prayag. Allahabad stands at the confluence of two of India's holiest rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna. Sangam, as the confluence is called, is the venue of many sacred fairs and rituals, and attracts thousands of pilgrims throughout the year. This number swells to millions during the Kumbh Mela. An annual Magh Mela is also held in Allahabad around the Sangam areas in the month of January (Magh is the name of month in Hindu calendar). A third mythical Saraswati river, believed to flow underground towards the Sangam, gives the confluence its other name, Triveni.
Emperor Akbar renamed this city in 1575 and called it Illahabas, which has now become modern Allahabad. The monarch realised its strategic importance as a waterway landmark in North India and also built a magnificent fort on the banks of the holy Sangam.
Over the centuries that followed, Allahabad remained on the forefront of national importance, especially during the days of the Indian independence struggle. The chequered history of Allahabad with its religious, cultural and historical ethos also gave rise to several renowned scholars (M. N. Saha, Harishchandra, Ravindra Khattree, Amar Nath Jha), poets (Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, Mahadevi Verma, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Sumitra Nandan Panth), writers (Mahadevi Verma, Ramkumar Verma, Jagdish Gupta), thinkers (Purusottam Das Tandon), statesmen and leaders (Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlala Nehru, Murli Manohar Joshi) and the actor Amitabh Bachchan.
The city, an important cantonment during the British Raj, has some beautiful remnants of colonial architecture. In the early 20th century, University of Allahabad was the foremost center of learning in the country.  Allahabad today is an important city where history, culture and religion create a confluence, much like the sacred rivers that caress it.
Allahabad used to have a thriving industrial suburb (Naini) till the 1980s, but then those public sector units started closing down one by one, forcing entire generations of young educated Allahabadis to migrate out of the city in search of work.  Today, Allahabad is slowly inching along in its dream to be an IT hub.  And the government administrative offices remain alive and kicking.
In Allahabad, you can enjoy
The politeness of "Aap" and "Hum" (literally, "us" and "we" in Hindi, used as a form of respect instead of the singular).
The subtle sense of humour of the person on the street
The fun of walking and travelling on rickshaws



Get in[edit][add listing]The best way to reach Allahabad, if you are coming from outside India, is to take a direct flight to Delhi and then take one of the numerous connecting trains from Delhi to Allahabad. The Kolkata Rajdhani express, though a better train, lands at a very odd hour in Allahabad (23:43) from Delhi which can be inconvenient for Allahabad being a really quiet place at night. Best train from Delhi to Allahabad is the PrayagRaj Express (Train No. 2418) which leaves from New Delhi Railway Station at 21:30 and arrives in Allahabad at 06:00 next day. The train runs every day. Newly launched is Duranto Express leaving Allahabad for New Delhi on Tuesdays, Thursdays & Saturdays at 22:40 hours and reaches New Delhi at 06:05 the next day with number 2275. This is a non-stop service with AC1, AC2, AC3 and non-AC 3 Tier composition. Down service from New Delhi leaves on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays at 23:00 and reaches Allahabad at 06:20 the next day with number 2276. Fares are marginally higher than other superfast and express trains.

During these days, Durga puja is also celebrated by Bengali community which makes a major section of Allahabadi society. Puja pandals of Darbhanga colony and Jagat Taran College are the best places to enjoy the marvelous works of craftsmen of the city.
Kumbh fair[edit][add listing]  Hindu pilgrims cross the river Ganges during the 2001 Kumbh fair.Kumbh is the best time to immerse yourself in Hindu rituals and culture, organized once in every 12 years. Kumbh 2001 became the largest ever human gathering in history when 80-90 million pilgrims converged.
The biggest festival for Hindus, the date are written in the ancient holy Vedas. The festivals of Makar Sankranti, Mauni Amavasya and Basant Panchami are the most auspicious days when 'Shahi Snaana' are held. The dates are set according to the complex Hindu calendar and change every year.
Every year, a smaller version of Kumbh called Magh Mela is organized which falls during the Hindu month of Magha (Usually January or February). Magh Mela is an auspicious time to get married and Allahabad will be bustling with marriage processions long into the night during this period.
The Kumbh area is a massive temporary settlement of tents at up on the flood plains of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers.
It is better to book the camps or hotels in advance as the number of visitors are unbelievably high and most regular accommodation sells out. Many Hindu families spend an entire month in rented tents, or in government tent camps where bunks can be booked for as little as 200IRP per night.
Getting around the camp :
The camp area was 40km long in 2019 and vehicles are generally banned (gurus and tourists on motorcycles are sometimes permitted). Ensure you know which sector your camp is in and arrive on the right edge or you could be forced to walk more than 10km.
There is generally no English signage, so asking police for directions may be your best option.
Temporary bridges across the river are generally one way, and the direction changes seemingly at random as police try to control the crowds.
For safety advice, see #Safety at Kumbh below.

Sangam[edit][add listing]A dip in the holy Sangam of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati is a must for the spiritually inclined. Sangam is a Sanskrit word for confluence. It is a sacred holy site for Hindus. According to Vedic literature and myths it is called Triveni Sangam because three rivers meet up here namely the holy Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati which is believed to be flowing beneath the surface. At the time of churning of sea (Samudra Manthan) by Gods (Suras) and the Demons (Asuras) few drops of amrita (holy nectar that makes a mortal immortal) fell at four different parts of the subcontinent during a fight between Gods and Demons over it.

Stay safe[edit]Power outages are frequent so be prepared and carry a flashlight. Alleys are hard to navigate during the day, and even harder at night, so always be prepared. Sometimes you might run into a cow in an alley.
Women should dress conservatively and be very careful as sexual assaults, such as random gropings, can be common. Don't travel alone, especially in less populated areas.Safety at Kumbh[edit]Deadly stampedes during Kumbh are commonplace: the enormous crowds frequently panic and defy police. Be aware of your surroundings, especially around the train station, bridges and rivers' edge.
Basic sanitation is lacking in many areas. Pilgrims not using toilets, flooding, and lack of drainage make diarrhea outbreaks common. Drink and use only bottled water and bring anti-diarrhea medication.
Alcohol is strictly forbidden, as are glass bottles and glasses.




Cope[edit]Knowing some basic Hindi and/or Urdu will help, although you can manage with English.
Be prepared to haggle with cyclerickshaw pullers (the best means of transport), for a short trip the price should be about ₹50, autorickshaws slightly less.
