There is no conclusive documented source available that traces the historical origin of Sheopur Fort. However a Jain pillar edict dated 1026 A.D. refers to the existence of the Sheopur fort. The 17th century poet Khadag Rai of Gwalior, in his renowned work Gopanchala Akhyana mentions Sheopur. According to his account the king of Nareshar Ajay Pal (1194–1219) had declared Sheopur as his capital.
In 1301 A.D. Alauddin Khalji after capturing the Ranthambhor fort, captured the Sheopur fort as well, which was under king Hammir Dev at that time. In 1489, Sultan Mahmood Khalji of Malwa captured and established it as an integrated part of the Malwa Sultanate.
In 1542, Sher Shah Suri captured the Sheopur fort. A prayer ground (idgah) built in his time and a grand mausoleum built by his son,   Islam Shah, in memory of his commander Munabber Khan are examples of the architecture of that time.
After that, Surjan Singh Hada, the King of Bundi captured Sheopur fort. In 1547, Akbar captured the fort and consequently it was awarded to the Gaurs of Agra by the Mughals for their assistance in fighting the Maharaj of Gwalior, Madhav Rao Scindia. The Gaurs continued to rule from it until they succumbed to the Scindias.
The 225 years history of the Sipahad kingdom is called a saga of untold valor[clarification needed] and forcefully independent cultural identity. This is reflected in architectural remains, which are individual thriving traditions of performing art, paintings, sculpture and highly artistic style of living. The individual palace of Narsingh Gaur, Rani mahal or Goojri mahal are striking examples of Gaur architecture. The chhartries built as a mark of respect for the king Indar Singh Gaur & and Kishor Das Gaur after the demise is silent and solemn examples of symmetrically well-crafted architecture. The Scandias remained in control of the fort till India acquired independence. They contributed to the grandeur of the fort by adding new dimensions to its resplendent remarks. The late Maharaja Madavrao Scindia built a Diwan-A-Aam, The Darbar Hall, and a state guesthouse presently the Diwan-A-Aam.
On the site is a Sahariya Museum, which is a window on the world of Saharia life partners, who rank as one of few existing primitive tribes of India. A few portion of the fort have been taken over by the M.P. Archeological Department for protections and conservation.
