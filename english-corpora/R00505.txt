In an interview with Capital FM, Lawson frontman Andy Brown revealed that "Standing in the Dark" is about his ex-girlfriend, the Saturdays member Mollie King and that he wrote the song with bandmate Ryan Fletcher after seeing photographs of her with someone else. He said: "What happened was, we split up and I wrote quite a few songs about it. It was hard because she just started going out with a ridiculously good looking guy after me. 'When She Was Mine' was a song about that, but 'Standing in the Dark' was the first song â€“ I wrote it with Ryan on the day we saw her with this new guy in the paper and stuff. It did hurt me hard."
