A mathematical symbol is a figure or a combination of figures that is used to represent a mathematical object, an action on mathematical objects, a relation between mathematical objects, or for structuring the other symbols that occur in a formula. As formulas are entirely constituted with symbols of various types, many symbols are needed for expressing all mathematics.The most basic symbols are the decimal digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and the letters of the Latin alphabet. The decimal digits are used for representing numbers through the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. Historically, upper-case letters were used for representing points in geometry, and lower-case letters were used for variables and constants. Letters are used for representing many other sort of mathematical objects. As the number of these sorts has dramatically increased in modern mathematics, the Greek alphabet and some Hebrew letters are also used. In mathematical formulas, the standard typeface is italic type for Latin letters and lower-case Greek letters, and upright type for upper case Greek letters. For having more symbols, other typefaces are also used, mainly boldface                               a          ,          A          ,          b          ,          B                ,        …              {\displaystyle \mathbf {a,A,b,B} ,\ldots }  , script typeface                                           A            ,            B                          ,        …              {\displaystyle {\mathcal {A,B}},\ldots }   (the lower-case script face is rarely used because of the possible confusion with the standard face), German fraktur                                           a            ,            A            ,            b            ,            B                          ,        …              {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {a,A,b,B}},\ldots }  , and blackboard bold                                           N            ,            Z            ,            Q            ,            R            ,            C            ,            H            ,            F                                q                                {\displaystyle \mathbb {N,Z,Q,R,C,H,F} _{q}}   (the other letters are rarely used in this face, or their use is unconventional).The use of Latin and Greek letters as symbols for denoting mathematical objects is not described in this article. For such uses, see Variable (mathematics) and List of mathematical constants. However, some symbols that are described here have the same shape as the letter from which they are derived, such as                               ∏                                          {\displaystyle \textstyle \prod {}}   and                               ∑                                          {\displaystyle \textstyle \sum {}}  .Theses letters alone are not sufficient for the needs of mathematicians, and many other symbols are used. Some take their origin in punctuation marks and diacritics traditionally used in typography; others by deforming letter forms, as in the cases of                     ∈              {\displaystyle \in }   and                     ∀              {\displaystyle \forall }  . Others, such as + and =, were specially designed for mathematics. Layout Normally, entries of a glossary are structured by topics and sorted alphabetically. This is not possible here, as there is no natural order on symbols, and many symbols are used in different parts of mathematics with different meanings, often completely unrelated. Therefore, some arbitrary choices had to be made, which are summarized below.The article is split into sections that are sorted by an increasing level of technicality. That is, the first sections contain the symbols that are encountered in most mathematical texts, and that are supposed to be known even by beginners. On the other hand, the last sections contain symbols that are specific to some area of mathematics and are ignored outside these areas. However, the long section on brackets has been placed near to the end, although most of its entries are elementary: this makes it easier to search for a symbol entry by scrolling.Most symbols have multiple meanings that are generally distinguished either by the area of mathematics where they are used or by their syntax, that is, by their position inside a formula and the nature of the other parts of the formula that are close to them.As readers may not be aware of the area of mathematics to which is related the symbol that they are looking for, the different meanings of a symbol are grouped in the section corresponding to their most common meaning.When the meaning depends on the syntax, a symbol may have different entries depending on the syntax. For summarizing the syntax in the entry name, the symbol                     ◻              {\displaystyle \Box }   is used for representing the neighboring parts of a formula that contains the symbol. See § Brackets for examples of use.Most symbols have two printed versions. They can be displayed as Unicode characters, or in LaTeX format. With the Unicode version, using search engines and copy-pasting are easier. On the other hand, the LaTeX rendering is often much better (more aesthetic), and is generally considered a standard in mathematics. Therefore, in this article, the Unicode version of the symbols is used (when possible) for labelling their entry, and the LaTeX version is used in their description. So, for finding how to type a symbol in LaTeX, it suffices to look at the source of the article.For most symbols, the entry name is the corresponding Unicode symbol. So, for searching the entry of a symbol, it suffices to type or copy the Unicode symbol into the search textbox. Similarly, when possible, the entry name of a symbol is also an anchor, which allows linking easily from another Wikipedia article. When an entry name contains special characters such as [, ], and |, there is also an anchor, but one has to look at the article source to know it.Finally, when there is an article on the symbol itself (not its mathematical meaning), it is linked to in the entry name. Arithmetic operators +1.  Denotes addition and is read as plus; for example, 3 + 2.2.  Sometimes used instead of                     ⊔              {\displaystyle \sqcup }   for a disjoint union of sets.–1.  Denotes subtraction and is read as minus; for example, 3 – 2.2.

For example, "the absolute value is denoted | · |" is clearer than saying that it is denoted as | |.±1.  Denotes either a plus sign or a minus sign.2.  Denotes the range of values that a measured quantity may have; for example, 10 ± 2 denotes an unknown value that lies between 8 and 12.∓Used paired with ±, denotes the opposite sign; that is, + if ± is –, and – if ± is +.÷Widely used for denoting division in anglophone countries, it is no longer in common use in mathematics and its use is "not recommended". In some countries, it can indicate subtraction.:1.  Denotes the ratio of two quantities.2.  In some countries, may denote division.3.  In set-builder notation, it is used as a separator meaning "such that"; see {□ : □}./1.  Denotes division and is read as divided by or over. Often replaced by a horizontal bar. For example, 3 / 2 or                                           3            2                                {\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}}  .2.  Denotes a quotient structure.

In probability theory, denotes a conditional probability. For example,                     P        (        A                  /                B        )              {\displaystyle P(A/B)}   denotes the probability of A, given that B occurs. Also denoted                     P        (        A        ∣        B        )              {\displaystyle P(A\mid B)}  : see "|".√Denotes square root and is read as the square root of. Rarely used in modern mathematics without an horizontal bar delimiting the width of its argument (see the next item). For example, √2.√  1.  Denotes square root and is read as the square root of. For example,                                           3            +            2                                {\displaystyle {\sqrt {3+2}}}  .2.  With an integer greater than 2 as a left superscript, denotes an nth root. For example,                                           3                          7                                            {\displaystyle {\sqrt[{7}]{3}}}  .^1.  Exponentiation is normally denoted with a superscript. However,                               x                      y                                {\displaystyle x^{y}}   is often denoted x^y when superscripts are not easily available, such as in programming languages (including LaTeX) or plain text emails.2.  Not to be confused with ∧. Equality, equivalence and similarity =1.  Denotes equality.2.  Used for naming a mathematical object in a sentence like "let                     x        =        E              {\displaystyle x=E}  ", where E is an expression. On a blackboard and in some mathematical texts, this may be abbreviated as                     x                                                                    =                                                              d                  e                  f                                                                            E              {\displaystyle x\,{\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\,E}   or                     x        ≜        E        .              {\displaystyle x\triangleq E.}   This is related to the concept of assignment in computer science, which is variously denoted (depending on the used programming language)                     =        ,        :=        ,                ,        ←        ,        …              {\displaystyle =,:=,,\leftarrow ,\ldots }  ≠Denotes inequality and means "not equal".≈Means "is approximately equal to".

Between two numbers, either it is used instead of ≈ to mean "approximatively equal", or it means "has the same order of magnitude as".2.  Denotes the asymptotic equivalence of two functions or sequences.3.  Often used for denoting other types of similarity, for example, matrix similarity or similarity of geometric shapes.4.  Standard notation for an equivalence relation.5.  In probability and statistics, may specify the probability distribution of a random variable. For example,                     X        ∼        N        (        0        ,        1        )              {\displaystyle X\sim N(0,1)}   means that the distribution of the random variable X is  standard normal.6.  Notation for showing proportionality. See also ∝ for a less ambiguous symbol.≡1.

That is, whatever A and B are, A ≥ B is equivalent to A > B or A = B.2.  Between two groups, may mean that the second one is a subgroup of the first one.≪ , ≫1.  Mean "much less than" and "much greater than". Generally, much is not formally defined, but means that the lesser quantity can be neglected with respect to the other. This is generally the case when the lesser quantity is smaller than the other by one or several orders of magnitude.2.  In measure theory,                     μ        ≪        ν              {\displaystyle \mu \ll \nu }   means that the measure                     μ              {\displaystyle \mu }   is absolutely continuous with respect to the measure                     ν              {\displaystyle \nu }  .≦1.  A rarely used synonym of ≤. Despite the easy confusion with ≤, some authors use it with a different meaning.≺ , ≻Often used for denoting an order or, more generally, a preorder, when it would be confusing or not convenient to use < and >. Set theory ∅Denotes the empty set, and is more often written                     ∅              {\displaystyle \emptyset }  . Using set-builder notation, it may also be denoted { }.#1.  Number of elements:                     #        S              {\displaystyle \#S}   may denote the cardinality of the set S. An alternative notation is                               |                S                  |                      {\displaystyle |S|}  ; see |□|.2.

In topology,                     M        #        N              {\displaystyle M\#N}   denotes the connected sum of two manifolds or two knots.∈Denotes set membership, and is read "in" or "belongs to". That is,                     x        ∈        S              {\displaystyle x\in S}   means that x is an element of the set S.∉Means "not in".

However two slightly different definitions are common. It seems that the first one is more commonly used in recent texts, since it allows often avoiding case distinctions.1.                      A        ⊂        B              {\displaystyle A\subset B}   may mean that A is a subset of B, and is possibly equal to B; that is, every element of A belongs to B; in formula,                     ∀        x        ,                x        ∈        A        ⇒        x        ∈        B              {\displaystyle \forall x,\,x\in A\Rightarrow x\in B}  .2.                      A        ⊂        B              {\displaystyle A\subset B}   may mean that A is a proper subset of B, that is the two sets are different, and every element of A belongs to B; in formula,                     A        ≠        B        ∧        ∀        x        ,                x        ∈        A        ⇒        x        ∈        B              {\displaystyle A\neq B\land \forall x,\,x\in A\Rightarrow x\in B}  .⊆                    A        ⊆        B              {\displaystyle A\subseteq B}   means that A is a subset of B. Used for emphasizing that equality is possible, or when the second definition is used for                     A        ⊂        B              {\displaystyle A\subset B}  .⊊                    A        ⊊        B              {\displaystyle A\subsetneq B}   means that A is a proper subset of B.

Sometimes,                     A        −        B              {\displaystyle A-B}   is used instead; see – in § Arithmetic operators.⊖Symmetric difference: that is,                     A        ⊖        B              {\displaystyle A\ominus B}   is the set formed by the elements that belong to exactly one of the two sets A and B.

Basic logic Several logical symbols are widely used in all mathematics, and are listed here. For symbols that are used only in mathematical logic, or are rarely used, see List of logic symbols.¬Denotes logical negation, and is read as "not". If E is a logical predicate,                     ¬        E              {\displaystyle \neg E}   is the predicate that evaluates to true if and only if E evaluates to false. For clarity, it is often replaced by the word "not". In programming languages and some mathematical texts, it is sometimes replaced by "~" or "!", which are easier to type on some keyboards.∨1.  Denotes the logical or, and is read as "or". If E and F are logical predicates,                     E        ∨        F              {\displaystyle E\lor F}   is true if either E, F, or both are true. It is often replaced by the word "or".2.

Thus,                     P        ⇒        Q              {\displaystyle P\Rightarrow Q}   is logically equivalent with                     Q        ∨        ¬        P              {\displaystyle Q\lor \neg P}  .2.

In Cryptography often denotes an error in place of a regular value.6.  For the use as a superscript, see □⊥. Blackboard bold The blackboard bold typeface is widely used for denoting the basic number systems. These systems are often also denoted by the corresponding uppercase bold letter.

Sometimes,                                           Z                                n                                {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} _{n}}   denotes the integers modulo n, where n is an integer greater than 0. The notation                               Z                          /                n                  Z                      {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} /n\mathbb {Z} }   is also used, and is less ambiguous.                              Q                      {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }  Denotes the set of rational numbers (fractions of two integers).

C                      {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }  Denotes the set of complex numbers. It is often denoted also by                               C                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {C} }  .

A        →        B              {\displaystyle A\to B}   denotes a function with domain A and codomain B. For naming such a function, one writes                     f        :        A        →        B              {\displaystyle f:A\to B}  , which is read as "f from A to B".2.  More generally,                     A        →        B              {\displaystyle A\to B}   denotes a homomorphism or a morphism from A to B. 3.  May denote a logical implication. For the material implication that is widely used in mathematics reasoning, it is nowadays generally replaced by ⇒. In mathematical logic, it remains used for denoting implication, but its exact meaning depends on the specific theory that is studied.4.  Over a variable name, means that the variable represents a vector, in a context where ordinary variables represent scalars; for example,                                           v            →                                {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {v}}}  .

In Euclidean geometry and more generally in affine geometry,                                                         P              Q                        →                                {\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {PQ}}}   denotes the vector defined by the two points P and Q, which can be identified with the translation that maps P to Q. The same vector can be denoted also                     Q        −        P              {\displaystyle Q-P}  ; see Affine space.↦Used for defining a function without having to name it. For example,                     x        ↦                  x                      2                                {\displaystyle x\mapsto x^{2}}   is the square function.○1.

Hadamard product of matrices: If A and B are two matrices of the same size, then                     A        ∘        B              {\displaystyle A\circ B}   is the matrix such that                     (        A        ∘        B                  )                      i            ,            j                          =        (        A                  )                      i            ,            j                          (        B                  )                      i            ,            j                                {\displaystyle (A\circ B)_{i,j}=(A)_{i,j}(B)_{i,j}}  . Possibly,                     ∘              {\displaystyle \circ }   is also used instead of ⊙ for the Hadamard product of power series.∂1.

Also used for the Cartesian product of any number of sets and the direct product of any number of mathematical structures.⊕1.  Internal direct sum: if E and F are abelian subgroups of an abelian group V, notation                     V        =        E        ⊕        F              {\displaystyle V=E\oplus F}   means that V is the direct sum of E and F; that is, every element of V can be written in a unique way as the sum of an element of E and an element of F. This applies also when E and F are linear subspaces or submodules of the vector space or module V.2.  Direct sum: if  E and F are two abelian groups, vector spaces, or modules, then their direct sum, denoted                     E        ⊕        F              {\displaystyle E\oplus F}   is an abelian group, vector space, or module (respectively) equipped with two monomorphisms                     f        :        E        →        E        ⊕        F              {\displaystyle f:E\to E\oplus F}   and                     g        :        F        →        E        ⊕        F              {\displaystyle g:F\to E\oplus F}   such that                     E        ⊕        F              {\displaystyle E\oplus F}   is the internal direct sum of                     f        (        E        )              {\displaystyle f(E)}   and                     g        (        F        )              {\displaystyle g(F)}  . This definition makes sense because this direct sum is unique up to a unique isomorphism.3.  Exclusive or: if E and F are two Boolean variables or predicates,                     E        ⊕        F              {\displaystyle E\oplus F}   may denote the exclusive or. Notations E XOR F and                     E        ⊻        F              {\displaystyle E\veebar F}   are also commonly used; see ⊻.⊗Denotes the tensor product. If E and F are abelian groups, vector spaces, or modules over a commutative ring, then the tensor product of E and F, denoted                     E        ⊗        F              {\displaystyle E\otimes F}   is an abelian group, a vector space or a module (respectively), equipped with a bilinear map                     (        e        ,        f        )        ↦        e        ⊗        f              {\displaystyle (e,f)\mapsto e\otimes f}   from                     E        ×        F              {\displaystyle E\times F}   to                     E        ⊗        F              {\displaystyle E\otimes F}  , such that the bilinear maps from                     E        ×        F              {\displaystyle E\times F}   to any abelian group, vector space or module G can be identified with the linear maps from                     E        ⊗        F              {\displaystyle E\otimes F}   to G. If E and F are vector spaces over a field R, or modules over a ring R, the tensor product is often denoted                     E                  ⊗                      R                          F              {\displaystyle E\otimes _{R}F}   to avoid ambiguity.⊤□1.  Transpose: if A is a matrix,                                                     ⊤                                          A              {\displaystyle ^{\top }\!\!A}   denotes the transpose of A, that is, the matrix obtained by exchanging rows and columns of A.

Orthogonal subspace in the dual space: If W is a linear subspace (or a submodule) of a vector space (or of a module) V, then                               W                      ⊥                                {\displaystyle W^{\bot }}   may denote the orthogonal subspace of W, that is, the set of all linear forms that map W to zero.3.  For inline uses of the symbol, see ⊥. Advanced group theory ⋉⋊1.  Inner semidirect product: if N and H are subgroups of a group G, such that N is a normal subgroup of G, then                     G        =        N        ⋊        H              {\displaystyle G=N\rtimes H}   and                     G        =        H        ⋉        N              {\displaystyle G=H\ltimes N}   mean that G is the semidirect product of N and H, that is, that every element of G can be uniquely decomposed as the product of an element of N and an element of H (unlike for the direct product of groups, the element of H may change if the order of the factors is changed). 2.  Outer semidirect product: if N and H are two groups, and                     φ              {\displaystyle \varphi }   is a group homomorphism from N to the automorphism group of H, then                     N                  ⋊                      φ                          H        =        H                  ⋉                      φ                          N              {\displaystyle N\rtimes _{\varphi }H=H\ltimes _{\varphi }N}   denotes a group G, unique up to a group isomorphism, which is a semidirect product of N and H, with the commutation of elements of N and H defined by                     φ              {\displaystyle \varphi }  .≀In group theory,                     G        ≀        H              {\displaystyle G\wr H}   denotes the wreath product of the groups G and H.

Infinite numbers ∞1.  The symbol is read as infinity. As an upper bound of a summation, an infinite product, an integral, etc., means that the computation is unlimited. Similarly,                     −        ∞              {\displaystyle -\infty }   in a lower bound means that the computation is not limited toward negative values.2.                      −        ∞              {\displaystyle -\infty }   and                     +        ∞              {\displaystyle +\infty }   are the generalized numbers that are added to the real line to form the extended real line.3.                      ∞              {\displaystyle \infty }   is the generalized number that is added to the real line to form the projectively extended real line.𝔠                                          c                                {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {c}}}   denotes the cardinality of the continuum, which is the cardinality of the set of real numbers.ℵWith an ordinal i as a subscript, denotes the ith aleph number, that is the ith infinite cardinal. For example,                               ℵ                      0                                {\displaystyle \aleph _{0}}   is the smallest infinite cardinal, that is, the cardinal of the natural numbers.ℶWith an ordinal i as a subscript, denotes the ith beth number.

In computer science, denotes the (unknown) greatest lower bound for the exponent of the computational complexity of matrix multiplication.4.  Written as a function of another function, it is used for comparing the asymptotic growth of two functions. See Big O notation § Related asymptotic notations.5.  In number theory, may denote the prime omega function. That is,                     ω        (        n        )              {\displaystyle \omega (n)}   is the number of distinct prime factors of the integer n. Brackets Many sorts of brackets are used in mathematics. Their meanings depend not only on their shapes, but also on the nature and the arrangement of what is delimited by them, and sometimes what appears between or before them. For this reason, in the entry titles, the symbol □ is used for schematizing the syntax that underlies the meaning.= Parentheses =(□)Used in an expression for specifying that the sub-expression between the parentheses has to be considered as a single entity; typically used for specifying the order of operations.□(□)□(□, □) □(□, ..., □)1.  Functional notation: if the first                     ◻              {\displaystyle \Box }   is the name (symbol) of a function, denotes the value of the function applied to the expression between the parentheses; for example,                     f        (        x        )              {\displaystyle f(x)}  ,                     sin        ⁡        (        x        +        y        )              {\displaystyle \sin(x+y)}  . In the case of a multivariate function, the parentheses contain several expressions separated by commas, such as                     f        (        x        ,        y        )              {\displaystyle f(x,y)}  .2.  May also denote a product, such as in                     a        (        b        +        c        )              {\displaystyle a(b+c)}  . When the confusion is possible, the context must distinguish which symbols denote functions, and which ones denote variables.(□, □)1.  Denotes an ordered pair of mathematical objects, for example,                     (        π        ,        0        )              {\displaystyle (\pi ,0)}  .2.  If a and b are real numbers,                     −        ∞              {\displaystyle -\infty }  , or                     +        ∞              {\displaystyle +\infty }  , and a < b, then                     (        a        ,        b        )              {\displaystyle (a,b)}   denotes the open interval delimited by a and b. See ]□, □[ for an alternative notation. 3.  If a and b are integers,                     (        a        ,        b        )              {\displaystyle (a,b)}   may denote the greatest common divisor of a and b. Notation                     gcd        (        a        ,        b        )              {\displaystyle \gcd(a,b)}   is often used instead.(□, □, □)If x, y, z are vectors in                                           R                                3                                {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}  , then                     (        x        ,        y        ,        z        )              {\displaystyle (x,y,z)}   may denote the scalar triple product.

Symbols that do not belong to formulas In this section, the symbols that are listed are used as some sorts of punctuation marks in mathematical reasoning, or as abbreviations of English phrases. They are generally not used inside a formula. Some were used in classical logic for indicating the logical dependence between sentences written in plain English. Except for the first two, they are normally not used in printed mathematical texts since, for readability, it is generally recommended to have at least one word between two formulas. However, they are still used on a black board for indicating relationships between formulas.■ , □Used for marking the end of a proof and separating it from the current text. The initialism Q.E.D. or QED (Latin: quod erat demonstrandum, "as was to be shown") is often used for the same purpose, either in its upper-case form or in lower case.☡Bourbaki dangerous bend symbol: Sometimes used in the margin to forewarn readers against serious errors, where they risk falling, or to mark a passage that is tricky on a first reading because of an especially subtle argument.∴Abbreviation of "therefore". Placed between two assertions, it means that the first one implies the second one. For example: "All humans are mortal, and Socrates is a human. ∴ Socrates is mortal."∵Abbreviation of "because" or "since". Placed between two assertions, it means that the first one is implied by the second one. For example: "11 is prime ∵ it has no positive integer factors other than itself and one."∋1.  Abbreviation of "such that". For example,                     x        ∋        x        >        3              {\displaystyle x\ni x>3}   is normally printed "x such that                     x        >        3              {\displaystyle x>3}  ".2.

See ∈ in § Set theory.∝Abbreviation of "is proportional to". Miscellaneous !1.  Factorial: if n is a positive integer, n! is the product of the first n positive integers, and is read as "n factorial".2.  Subfactorial: if n is a positive integer, !n is the number of derangements of a set of n elements, and is read as "the subfactorial of n".*Many different uses in mathematics; see Asterisk § Mathematics.|1.  Divisibility: if m and n are two integers,                     m        ∣        n              {\displaystyle m\mid n}   means that m divides n evenly.2.

Restriction of a function: if f is a function, and S is a subset of its domain, then                     f                              |                                S                                {\displaystyle f|_{S}}   is the function with S as a domain that equals f on S.4.  Conditional probability:                     P        (        X        ∣        E        )              {\displaystyle P(X\mid E)}   denotes the probability of X given that the event E occurs. Also denoted                     P        (        X                  /                E        )              {\displaystyle P(X/E)}  ; see "/".5.  For several uses as brackets (in pairs or with ⟨ and ⟩) see § Other brackets.∤Non-divisibility:                     n        ∤        m              {\displaystyle n\nmid m}   means that n is not a divisor of m.∥1.  Denotes parallelism in elementary geometry: if PQ and RS are two lines,                     P        Q        ∥        R        S              {\displaystyle PQ\parallel RS}   means that they are parallel.2.  Parallel, an arithmetical operation used in electrical engineering for modeling parallel resistors:                     x        ∥        y        =                              1                                                            1                  x                                            +                                                1                  y                                                                          {\displaystyle x\parallel y={\frac {1}{{\frac {1}{x}}+{\frac {1}{y}}}}}  .3.  Used in pairs as brackets, denotes a norm; see ||□||.∦Sometimes used for denoting that two lines are not parallel; for example,                     P        Q        ∦        R        S              {\displaystyle PQ\not \parallel RS}  .⊙Hadamard product of power series: if                               S          =                      ∑                          i              =              0                                      ∞                                            s                          i                                            x                          i                                            {\displaystyle \textstyle S=\sum _{i=0}^{\infty }s_{i}x^{i}}   and                               T          =                      ∑                          i              =              0                                      ∞                                            t                          i                                            x                          i                                            {\displaystyle \textstyle T=\sum _{i=0}^{\infty }t_{i}x^{i}}  , then                               S          ⊙          T          =                      ∑                          i              =              0                                      ∞                                            s                          i                                            t                          i                                            x                          i                                            {\displaystyle \textstyle S\odot T=\sum _{i=0}^{\infty }s_{i}t_{i}x^{i}}  .
