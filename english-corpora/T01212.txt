History[edit]
The Nagaur Fort is of historical importance. Nagaur fort is the fort built by the ancient Kshatriya of India. The original maker of the fort is Naagvanshi Kshatriya.[1] The Kshatriya rulers dominated Nagaur for a long period of time. Nagaur ruler were repeatedly forced to pay tribute to the Sisodias of Chittor while their lands were slowly annexed by the Rathore of Jodhpur. The ancient name of the city was Ahichhatrapur.
In the medieval era, the town of Nagaur sat astride trade routes coming north from Gujarat and Sindh and those on the west crossing the Indus from Multan. With a dead flat plain all around, the defence of the fort depended on the military and economic power of its rulers. And from the period of the Ghaznavid invasions Nagaur was under the powerful Chauhan clan. A succession of rulers kept the whole of Jangladesh free from foreign rule down to the reign of Prithviraj Chauhan III at the close of the 12th Century. That Nagaur town came under the invaders is clear since Balban, before becoming Sultan, was given an estate centered on this desert town. But just as there were petty Hindu chiefs (of numerous castes) in the vast lands between Ajmer and Delhi, it is reasonable to suppose that such landholders were also present in the lands between Ajmer and Nagaur, paying land revenue to the Muslims and probably joining their army.
Another similarity between Ajmer and Nagaur is the early founding of Sufi shrines at both places. One of the earliest Sufis to come to Nagaur was Sultan Tarkin, whose shrine was established during Hindu rule. After Khwaja Moinuddin established the Chishti Sufi order at Ajmer one of his disciples, named Hamiduddin, came to Nagaur. Hamiduddin accommodated some Hindu principles in his teachings—he became a strict vegetarian and lovingly reared a cow in his shrine.
In 1306, a Mongol army along with khokars ravaged Nagaur. The Khalji Turks had begun pushing deeper into the lands of the independent Rajput rulers and even further into South India. In the midst of this expansion they lost some of the important Rajput forts like Jaisalmer, Chittor, and Siwana, while guerrilla warfare made the regions of Marwar and Mewar impassable for the Muslim armies. Some of the other forts and towns were lost to the Rajputs after the break-up of the Delhi Sultanate in 1351. With the death of Firuz Shah Tughlaq in 1388, the remaining strongholds like Ajmer and Nagaur came under their own hereditary governors.
Turks of the Dandani tribe became Sultans, The Sultans of Nagaur taxed the money earned by the people from trade, agriculture, and from the vast herds of cattle, goats, and camels. In addition, like in the Delhi Sultanate, jaziya and a pilgrimage tax taken from Hindus brought significant sums to the treasury and enabled the Dandani Turks to match their neighbours in battle.
While Nagaur was still swearing a nominal allegiance to Delhi, two ominous events occurred in the neighbuorhood within a short period. One was the campaign of Rana Lakha (1389–1404) of Mewar, which saw a Rajput army ravaging Ajmer and pushing on to the Jhunjhunu region near Delhi. The second was the capture of Mandore by Rao Chunda (1390–1422) of the Rathore clan—this city henceforth became the Rathore capital and gave Rao Chunda a convenient base for attacking Nagaur.
Rao Chunda also changed horses mid-stream and formed an alliance with Mewar, where the Rathore princess Hamsabai was married to the old Rana Lakha, who in turn promised to make her son the next Rana. On the strength of this alliance Chunda subdued Rajput clans like the Bhatis and Mohils and again invaded Nagaur, forcing Muslim rulers to make peace by paying him tribute. In 1422 these three defeated powers made an alliance and killed Chunda on the outskirts of Nagaur—Chunda's son Ranamalla was then at Mewar and his brothers sought to capture the throne at Mandore.
With the help of the Mewar army, Ranamall defeated his brothers and became the head of the Rathore clan. In 1428 he led this joint Sesodia-Rathore army to punish the Turks of Nagaur where he stormed the fort and killed Firuz Khan( khokhar). The next Sultan of Nagaur Qiyam Khan Khokhar paid tribute to Mewar till 1438 when Ranamall Rathore was killed at Chittor and the Sesodias invaded Marwar. The conflict between the two Rajput clans was the opportunity for the Nagaur that had been smarting under their dominance—the Sultans of Gujarat and Malwa fought Mewar for almost twenty years and were ultimately compelled to form an alliance against the strong Rajput state.
With its two Rajput enemies simultaneously in trouble, Nagaur regained independence and its Sultans their former power, which was reflected in the internal politics of the neighbouring Delhi Sultanate. In 1451 the minister of the last Sayyid ruler invited Qiyam Khan khokhar to seize Delhi and become Sultan—at the same time he sent a similar invitation to Bahlul Lodi, the Afghan governor of Sirhind. The latter, being closer to Delhi, reached first and established the Lodi dynasty, while the disappointed Qiyam Khan Khokhar retired with his army to Nagaur.
After his death in 1453, the succession to the Nagaur throne was disputed between the brothers Mujahid Khan Khokhar and Shams Khan Khokhar. Rana Kumbha, who had emerged victorious in the long war with the Sultan of Malwa and the Rathores, sent his army to aid Shams Khan Khokhar who was installed as the Sultan. As a price of his support, Kumbha demanded that a portion of the Nagaur fort be demolished, but this Shams Khan Khokhar would not do—instead, he formed a matrimonial alliance with Sultan Qutb-ud-din of Gujarat.
In 1456 Rana Kumbha defeated the allied Muslim army and again captured Nagaur. On this occasion the great mosque at Nagaur, built by Firuz Khan khokhar, was demolished by the Rajputs to signify Kumbha's displeasure against Shams Khan Khokhar and to impose the status of a vassal on him.
For the next two years the Sultans of Gujarat ( Uncle of Shams Khan Khokhar) and Malwa formed an alliance to fight against Rana Kumbha, but by this time Mewar had again become the dominant power in North India—not the least because of a peace treaty with the Rathore clan.
Rao Jodha, the head of the Rathore clan, had founded a new capital called Jodhpur and had recovered most of his other forts from the Sisodias. The war between the two clans was brought to an end in 1458 by a treaty. But this did not make Nagaur independent—rather its territory became food for the hungry and fast multiplying Rathore clan.
Jodha's son Rao Bika, with a portion of the Rathore clansmen, captured the northern portions of Nagaur and founded a new city called Bikaner. Another son named Rao Duda captured Merta lying to the east of Nagaur—the Sultanate of Nagaur was now shrunk to the main town and a few surrounding villages. The policy of the sultans was to maintain independence by either paying tribute to the head of the Rathore clan or to the Lodis of Delhi.
In 1513 Nagaur was defeated and compelled to pay tribute—subsequently Lunkaran protected Nagaur, as his vassal state, from an attack by his own kinsman Rao Ganga of Jodhpur. The territory of the Sultanate had now shrunk to just the town of Nagaur.
In Nagaur though, the powerless dynasty of the Khokhar was formally ended and an Afghan army was left in control of the fort and town. This force was ousted by the Mughals under Akbar in 1562. Akbar also captured the fief of Merta—the Rathore ruler of Merta, the Jaimal took up service with the Rana of Chittor and died defending that fort from Akbar in 1569. Akbar's campaign in Rajputana had some similarity with Sher Shah Suri's in that he made alliances with the smaller Rajput states like Bikaner and Amber and used them against the bigger states.
Nagaur remained under Mughal control, but was actually administered by one of the nearby Rajput rulers. In the time of Shahjahan the heir of the Jodhpur throne, Amar Singh Rathore was disinherited by his father and was granted Nagaur as compensation by the Mughal Emperor. Many of the buildings in the town date from this period. During Aurangzeb's war against the Rathores in 1679, the headship of the clan was given to Indra Singh (grandson of Amar Singh Rathore) of Nagaur—but he was overthrown by Jaswant Singh's son Ajit Singh and his general Durgadas Rathore who permanently annexed Nagaur to the Kingdom of Jodhpur but it was given back to Indra Singh's son Mokham Singh.
In 1755 Jayappaji Rao Scindia (King of Gawalior) attacked on Nagaur fort. He was having huge army and defeated all state which comes in his way. He halted his army at Tausar (5 km (3.1 mi)) from Nagaur, near a pond. He surrounded the Nagaur fort and stopped food and ration. Maharaja Vijay Singh sent proposal of treaty but Jayappa Sindhia not accepted it.
Vijay Singh announced in Darbaar that it's a difficult time for Marwar and asked for volunteers to kill Jayappa Sindhia. Gajji Khan Khokhar( chawta Kalla) and one Dotlai Rajput Gehlot were volunteered . Gajji Khan Khokhar and Rajput soldier changed their outfit as small traders and opened their shop near Army of Jayappa Sindhia. For 2 months they noted down all activities and made plan accordingly. On 25 July 1755 Gaji khan khokhar and Dotlai Rajput according plan started fighting with each other  and reached near Jayappa Sindhia for justice. Both took out their daggers, Gajji Khan piraced dagger in the chest of Jayappa and said it's a Nagaur, Rajput piraced the dagger in his belly and said it's Jodhpur ( Painting situated in Mandore Museum of Mandore, Jodhpur). They killed Jayappa Sindhia, army of Jai Appa surprised and attacked on both the soldier and killed them. After that a common proverb is still in Nagaur that "Khokhar badda khuraki kha gyo haappa jiyanka daaki". Scindia army fought for sometime without gaining success.
