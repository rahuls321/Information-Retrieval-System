Sirohi National Park or Shirui National Park (Manipuri: Shirui Leipaakki Lampaak) is the world's only habitat for the Shirui Lily (Lilium macklineae)(Manipuri: Shirui Tharo). It covers the slopes of the Shirui hills (Siroy hills) in Ukhrul, northern Manipur in India. It is famous for being the home of the world's only terrestrial lily species, Shirui Lily (Lilium macklineae) (Manipuri: Shirui Tharo). Despite many serious experiments of numerous scientists to plant the Lily species in other parts of Earth, none succeed till today. The national park is a major tourist attraction in North Manipur. It draws over thousands of tourists (including botanists) every month.
The term "Sirohi" is also spelled as Shiroy, Siroy, Shiroi, Siroi, Shirui or Sirui.
