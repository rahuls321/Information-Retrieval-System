Motivation The conjugate transpose can be motivated by noting that complex numbers can be usefully represented by 2×2 real matrices, obeying matrix addition and multiplication:                    a        +        i        b        ≡                              [                                                            a                                                  −                  b                                                                              b                                                  a                                                      ]                          .              {\displaystyle a+ib\equiv {\begin{bmatrix}a&-b\\b&a\end{bmatrix}}.}  That is, denoting each complex number z by the real 2×2 matrix of the linear transformation on the Argand diagram (viewed as the real vector space                                           R                                2                                {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}  ), affected by complex z-multiplication on                               C                      {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }  .Thus, an m-by-n matrix of complex numbers could be well represented by a 2m-by-2n matrix of real numbers. The conjugate transpose therefore arises very naturally as the result of simply transposing such a matrix—when viewed back again as n-by-m matrix made up of complex numbers.

Generalizations The last property given above shows that if one views                               A                      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {A}}}   as a linear transformation from Hilbert space                                           C                                n                                {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{n}}   to                                           C                                m                          ,              {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{m},}   then the matrix                                           A                                              H                                            {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {A}}^{\mathrm {H} }}   corresponds to the adjoint operator of                               A                      {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {A}}}  . The concept of adjoint operators between Hilbert spaces can thus be seen as a generalization of the conjugate transpose of matrices with respect to an orthonormal basis.Another generalization is available: suppose                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is a linear map from a complex vector space                     V              {\displaystyle V}   to another,                     W              {\displaystyle W}  , then the complex conjugate linear map as well as the transposed linear map are defined, and we may thus take the conjugate transpose of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   to be the complex conjugate of the transpose of                     A              {\displaystyle A}  . It maps the conjugate dual of                     W              {\displaystyle W}   to the conjugate dual of                     V              {\displaystyle V}  .
