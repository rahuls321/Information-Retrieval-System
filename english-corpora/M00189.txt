Lupanov's (k, s)-representation, named after Oleg Lupanov, is a way of representing Boolean circuits so as to show that the reciprocal of the Shannon effect. Shannon had showed that almost all Boolean functions of n variables need a circuit of size at least 2nn−1. The reciprocal is that:All Boolean functions of n variables can be computed with a circuit of at most 2nn−1 + o(2nn−1) gates. Definition The idea is to represent the values of a boolean function ƒ in a table of 2k rows, representing the possible values of the k first variables x1, ..., ,xk, and 2n−k columns representing the values of the other variables.Let A1, ..., Ap be a partition of the rows of this table such that for i < p, |Ai| = s and                               |                          A                      p                                    |                =                  s          ′                ≤        s              {\displaystyle |A_{p}|=s'\leq s}  .Let ƒi(x) = ƒ(x) iff x ∈ Ai.Moreover, let                               B                      i            ,            w                                {\displaystyle B_{i,w}}   be the set of the columns whose intersection with                               A                      i                                {\displaystyle A_{i}}   is                     w              {\displaystyle w}  .
