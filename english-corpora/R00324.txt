Isaac Freeman III (born August 6, 1971), better known by his stage name Fatman Scoop, is an American rapper, promoter and radio personality famed for his on-stage rough, raw loud voice.
He is known for the song "Be Faithful", which topped the charts in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland in October 2003, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in Denmark and Australia. The song had been a favorite in clubs around the world for years but it took two years to clear the samples from Jay-Z, Black Sheep, Queen Pen, The Beatnuts and Faith Evans. He has also collaborated with numerous artists, such as Lil Jon, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, Pitbull and Skrillex, among others.


== Career ==
Fatman Scoop also has his own ice cream parlor and relationship show/podcast. All episodes can also be seen on the Man and Wife channel on internet TV network, ONLOQ.com, as well as MTV. He also appeared as himself on the TV series The Boondocks (season 2, episode 5, "The Story of Thugnificent" and episode 15, "The Story of Gangstalicious Part 2", from the same season); however since the show premiered, the relationship between Fatman Scoop and his wife soured and they subsequently divorced.
Fatman Scoop was interviewed by radio personality Madison Jaye in a YouTube video that was published on March 22, 2014. During the interview, Fatman Scoop reveals that he received his stage name when he was a baby from his Uncle Jack, who would call him "Fatman Scoop" because he loved to eat ice cream. People had thought that he received his stage name after appearing in the Fugees' "Killing Me Softly" video as a cinema worker serving popcorn and ice-cream. Lauryn Hill was a massive ice-cream fan herself so she would shout 'scoop, scoop, Fatman Scoop' when she wanted a tub of her favorite snack. But Fatman Scoop stated "I was already Fatman Scoop on the radio when that video came out."On August 27, 2015, he entered the Celebrity Big Brother house in the United Kingdom as a contestant. On September 14, he was the third housemate to be evicted, on day 20.
