  Lions and tiger in a cage at the 1904 World's Fair
Historically, a comparison of the tiger (Panthera tigris) versus the lion (Panthera leo)[1][2] has been a popular topic of discussion by hunters,[3][4] naturalists,[5] artists and poets. It has historically inspired the popular imagination.[6][7][8][9] In the past, lions and tigers reportedly competed in the wilderness,[10][11] where their ranges overlapped in Eurasia.[1][12] The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in captivity,[13] either deliberately[7][14] or accidentally.[10][15]

Opinions
In general, the lion is a social animal, while the tiger is solitary,[2][16] though at times, male lions (especially in India) are separate from the females,[17][18] and tigers socialise, usually for mating, and rarely for hunts.[19] There are differing scenarios regarding whether tigers would beat lions in fights, or vice-versa:[10][20]

Favoring the tiger
Craig Saffoe, a biologist and the curator of great cats at the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., said that the outcome of a given fight totally depended on the individuals, with their fighting style, physiology and history, but that he would bet on the tiger winning. He also reckoned that the big cats ranked, from higher to lower, with tigers, jaguars and lions on top, and then cougars, snow leopards, leopards, and cheetahs. At the same time, he said that the most interesting "match-up would be a good size Bengal tiger and a good-size male jaguar," because they had roughly the same speed, temperament, size and strength, in his opinion.[21]
Favoring the lion
Dave Hoover, the animal trainer for Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers Circus, mentions that he lost many tigers to male lions: "I have to keep the male lions from killing each other. I have to keep them from killing the tigers [...]. I have lost tigers."[22] Although Hoover had his lions gang up on his tigers, "Two lions killed one of his tigers during training in Ojus, Fla., in 1966",[23] in another newspaper he states he has trouble "keeping the lion from attacking the lone tiger".[24]
Renowned Indian naturalist and conservationist Kailash Sankhala wrote in his 1978 book Tiger! The Story of the Indian Tiger that the tiger would be unable to get close to the lion's vital joints because of his thick mane, and that the tiger would be vulnerable to the lion. He mentioned that once an Indian prince organized a fight in which the lion killed the tiger, and opined that "a tiger is no match for even a single lion of equal strength".[20]

As of 2021, India is the only country to have both wild lions and tigers, specifically Asiatic lions and Bengal tigers.[2][26][27] Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past,[10][28][19][29] and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.[30][31]
Before the end of the 20th century, Asiatic lions[32][33] and Caspian tigers[34][35] had occurred in other Asian[36] or Eurasian nations, including Iran.[2][12][27][19] As such, there is a word for 'Lion',[1][2][12][33] which can also mean 'Tiger',[19][37] and is used in Iran, South Asia and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' (Persian: شیر),[38] and its significance is discussed below. Not only did Heptner and Sludskiy had talk about the lion and tiger both occurring in places like Iran, Anatolia and Transcaucasia, they also mentioned that the ranges of the lion and tiger often overlapped.[1]
According to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large herbivores, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers one-against-one, as they would with each other.[36] Apart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce hybrid offspring, which would be ligers or tigons.[39][40][41][42][43] From the fossil record, besides genetics,[2][35][44] it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the Pleistocene, when now-extinct relatives also existed there.[1][32][34] Additionally, in the days before Indian Independence, the Maharaja of Gwalior introduced African lions into his area, which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.[45]

The possibility of conflict between lions and tigers had been raised in relation to India's Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project, which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the lion, that is Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh,[30] before December 2017.[46][47] Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'.[10][31] Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would "trigger frequent clashes".[48] At the same, the American biologist Craig Packer and his students at the University of Minnesota considered that a group of lions (two to three males) would have a clear advantage over a tiger and a pack of lionesses (two to four females) would have a similar advantage over a tigress, despite the general advantage of the latter in weight or height. Coalitions of male lions usually fight as a group against territorial rivals, so he mentions that a tiger may have an advantage in a one-on-one encounter, but they also considered that the additional fighting experience and mane perhaps confer an advantage to a lone male lion since the tiger's fighting style evolved in the absence of a mane. Despite all of this, Craig Packer is of the opinion that for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be moved there as intact groups rather than as individuals.[10] Although the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favour solitary hunters of prey,[20] these lions are social like their African relatives,[49] and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary.[10]
Reginald Innes Pocock (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Indian Subcontinent before lions. The tigers likely entered Northern India from the eastern end of the Himalayas, through Burma, and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from Balochistan or Persia, and spread to places like the Bengal and the Nerbudda River. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it,[19] as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers.[1][2][34][19][29] As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.[19]

Observed fights
In the circuses of Ancient Rome, exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other,[14] including Barbary lions[2][50][51] and tigers.[52] A mosaic in the House of the Faun in Pompeii shows a fight between a lion and a tiger.[53] There are different accounts of which of these animals gained the victory. Although lions and tigers can be kept together in harmony in captivity,[54] fatal conflicts have also been recorded.[7][55][56][57]
In addition to historical recordings, clashes between lions and tigers were reported or even caught on camera[58] in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was not always clear which species regularly beat the other, according to Doctor Packer (2015).[10][11]

In captivity
Martial's epigrams describes an account between a Caspian tigress and a lion where the tiger was victorious, tearing the lion to pieces.[59]
In 1830, a tiger attacked a lion at a menagerie in Turin, Rome. Despite having attacked first, the lion maneuvered it onto its back, and grasped the tiger's throat with its jaws. The tiger died after that.[60]
Clark (1838) said that a British officer, who resided many years at Sierra Leone, saw many fights between lions and tigers, and that the tiger 'universally' won.[28][a]
In 1850 a fight took place in an Amphitheatre between a lion and a tiger, the lion gave in and was killed.[61][62]
A newspaper Harper's Weekly in 1859, mentioned a ten-minute fight in London[63][64] where a tiger named 'Gunga', who had previously belonged to the King of Oude, killed nearly 30 lions. After its arrival in England there was a fight where a lion was killed in 10 minutes.[65] A 1857 London newspaper referring to the same incident reported the lion was a "very fine lion, six or seven years old".[66] One source stated the lion was in confinement (captivity) for three years, implying the lion would be three years old at a minimum.[67] While the tiger was of 18 months of age, but of large size.[68] A newspaper refers to the tiger 'Gunga', whose name was also "Nina Shahib" and who, before the fight took place with the lion in London, had attacked its keeper. The two animals were found fighting each other, in which the keepers made fruitless efforts to part the two animals. Towards the end of the fight, the lion gained a brief advantage, were its mane deflected the tigers attack[69] at which point the tiger, while on his back, with swift strikes and using his back legs, tore open the lion's stomach. The lion died after that. The tiger "Nina Shahib" was thought to have been mortally injured. However, the tiger did recover and became one of the biggest attractions of the establishment.[70]
In 1868 a lion died from injuries with a fight from a tiger which was proved by a post mortem at Queen's menagerie.[71]
In 1882, a fight started in a menagerie and the tiger fixed his fangs into the lion's throat with blood gushing out, killing the lion.[72]
In 1891, a fight happened at Calcutta Zoo, between an African lioness and a tigress, They were exhibited in adjoining compartments of the same cage, and the door having been carelessly opened between the two compartments, the tigress rushed in and disposed of her rival in a fight which lasted about 10 minutes.[73]
In 1892 at Forepaugh circus parade in Pottstown Pennsylvania a fierce fight pursued, the female tiger teared open the lion's flesh on the back of the head.[74]
According to the Gettysburg Compiler and The Baltimore Sun (1899), towards the end of the 19th century in India, the Gaekwad of Baroda, that is Sayajirao III,[75][76] arranged a fight in an amphitheater, between a magnificent prime wild Barbary lion called 'Atlas', from the Atlas Mountains between Algeria and Morocco, and a man-eating Bengal tiger from the Indian region of Shimla, both large and hungry (with their diets reduced before the fight), before an audience of thousands, instead of between an Indian lion and the tiger, as Indian lions were believed to be no match for Bengal tigers. The tiger was more than 10 feet (3.0 metres) long, over 4 feet (120 centimetres) feet at the shoulder, had strong shoulders and long teeth and claws, and was agile. The lion looked taller at the head than the tiger, and had a large mane, legs and paws. The tiger was seen as "the personification of graceful strength and supple energy," whereas the lion was seen as the "embodiment of massive power and adamantine muscle".[57] In the fight, both cats sustained injuries, and although the tiger sometimes retreated from Atlas, it would come back to fight it, and in the end, managed to scratch Atlas to death, though Atlas pushed it off in one final move before dying. The Gaekwad agreed to pay 37,000 rupees, accepted that the tiger was the "King of the Cat Family," decreed that Atlas' body be given a Royal burial, and that the tiger should have a "cage of honour" in the menagerie of Baroda, and decided to prepare the tiger for a battle with a Sierran grizzly bear weighing more than 1,500 lb (680 kilograms). The battle was to happen after the tiger recovered from its wounds.[7][57]
In 1903 there was a terrifying scene at a Menagerie in Florence. While a tamer was engaged in his performance in the lions' den, one of the animals managed to break through the door into a neighbouring cage, in which was a huge tiger. A fierce fight ensued between the beasts, the tiger finally succumbing (dying) to ghastly wounds in the neck. The lion also was badly bitten.[77] In the meantime, the visitors had fled panic-stricken, and the terrified tamer had disappeared from the show.[78][79]
In 1903 Osmona Breland a professor of zoology at the University of Texas once saw a staged fight between a tiger and a lion, which the tiger won. The tiger used both paws, but the lions used only one at a time, and this situation turned out to be quite disadvantageous to the well-being of the lion[80][81]
At the Coney Island animal show in 1909, a performing lion named Prince attacked a chained tiger by leaping through the air when the tiger was facing away, another lion intervened too, both the lions names imply they were male, and landed on the tiger's back. Though hampered by the heavy neck chain fastened to the iron bars of the arena, the tiger was more than a match for the lion and mangled it to death. Prince's face was torn, limping with his sides and his flanks were torn.[82][83]
In 1911, a staged fight was set between a bengal tiger and a lion, though the tiger ended up killing the lion, the same tiger later lost to an American grizzly bear.[84]
In 1911, Frank Bostock gave an account of a lion killing a tiger.[85]
In May 1914, at New York's Bronx Zoo, the barrier between the cages of Rajah, an eight-year-old Bengal tiger, and Huerte, a Nubian lion three years old, was opened in an "unaccountable manner". For the first few minutes, the more agile Huerte appeared to be winning, but when it aimed for its injured opponent's neck, about an hour into the fight, Rajah aimed for its nape. Not only did Rajah manage to bite Huerte's nape, but it also broke Huerte's back, thus slaughtering it.[86][87]
In 1924 a tiger owned by Mabel Stark killed 2 lions and 2 tigers.[88]
In 1926, two mortal fights happened in the United States, two tigers killed two lions [89]
In 1932 a male and female tiger, separate from a male lion and lioness in an Indian zoo managed to meet as one of the doors on the steel partition separating them was unlocked allowing them to interact and in under a minute two lions died from the result of a fight.[90]
In 1934, a fully grown African lion killed a mature Bengal tiger a short time after these circus animals were unloaded from the train and before trainers could separate them.[15]
In 1937 a vigorous lion and tiger fought in a German zoo, the lion died as a result.[91]
3 June (1949), in Fitchburg when the Biller Brothers circus moved on to its next stop, it left behind the remains of a 1000 pound tiger. The tiger was killed last night in a savage battle with a lion.[92]
At the South Perth Zoo in 1949, in a three-minute fight between a lion and a tiger, the lion killed the tiger. The fight occurred when the tiger put his head through a connecting slide. The lion caught the tiger by the throat, and, dragging it through the opening, killed it before the keepers arrived.[93]
In 1956, Roman Proske's black maned lion, Achmed jumped onto the back of a tiger though one of the trainers intervened by a fork hitting the lion, the tiger ended up killing the lion by a single bite.[94][95]
In 1959 Maharaja of Gwalior experimented if lions could thrive in India despite their decline, the lions used were African specimens and defined as fine. After a single day the male lion was killed from a fight of one of the tigers, the previous pair of lions already left the area by the time of the lion's death[96]
In September 2010, a Bengal tiger at the Ankara Zoo passed through a gap, between its cage and that of a lion, and killed it with a single paw swipe. "The tiger severed the lion's jugular vein in a single stroke with its paw, leaving the animal dying in a pool of blood," officials said. The tiger was also said to previously injured the lion a year before. However, despite being reported in local news at the time, the incident was reported in international media only in March 2011.[97][98][99]
In 2018 during the Zapashny brother's act[clarification needed] a tiger attacked a lion by knocking him down and biting the neck. One of the trainers stated the tiger would have strangled the lion if they had not got involved.[100][101]
In 2020 a male lion named Tarzan whose lip was torn from a fight with a tiger.[102] Another source states Tanya the lioness was also injured and Tarzan's tooth was broken, too.[103]

  A Mughal painting of a Dervish with a lion and tiger in India
Herne (1855) mentioned that in the Indian jungle between the village of Elaw, city of Baroche, and Gulf of Cambay, north of the city of Surat and its Ghauts, about 6 or 7 mi (9.7 or 11.3 km) from the village, he and his party, which included locals, heard a tiger's roar. Pursuing it, they caught a glimpse of it, but by that time, the tiger had attacked a local. It disappeared with the victim, and after pursuing it for about 50 yd (46 m), they heard the roar of a lion, and besides it, sounds which suggested that it was in a struggle with the tiger, such as growls. The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger. The author termed both the lion and tiger as "tyrants of the forest," given that they would attack weaker creatures. The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile. As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back. They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured. It caught the tiger's throat, turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open. The lion was thus hailed as the "King of Beasts". Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims.[104]
The Sun (New York) reported that in a depopulated Indian village at the bank of a creek connected to the Cauvery River, about 30 mi (48 km) north-west of Bangalore, a hunter injured by a venomous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side. The tiger was a "rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life," and had muscular limbs. The male lion was "medium-sized". Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first, as they were separated by a wall that was about 4 ft (120 cm) tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry cat, which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary,[105] but that was not the case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like that of dogs unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about 2 ft (61 cm) deep, and this stopped the fight. They retreated from each other, limping into the forest.[b]

Battles between the two were painted in the 18th and 19th centuries by Eugène Delacroix, George Stubbs[110] and James Ward. James Ward's paintings portrayed lion victories in accordance with the lion's symbolic value in Britain, and have been described as less realistic than Stubbs.[110]
The British Seringapatam medal shows a lion defeating a tiger in battle; an Arabic language banner on the medal displays the words Asad Allāh al-Ghālib (Arabic: أَسَد الله الْغَالِب, "Lion of God the Conqueror"). The medal commemorated the British victory at the 1799 Battle of Seringapatam (in the town now known as Srirangapatna) over Tipu Sultan — who used tigers as emblems, as opposed to the British emblematic use of lions.[111]

Literature
  A 1739 advertisement by Charles Benjamin Incledon featuring feliforms: the Mesopotamian lion from the vicinity of Bassorah, Cape lion, tiger from the East Indies, panther from Buenos Aires, Hyaena hyaena from West Africa, and leopard from Turkey, besides a "Man tyger" from Africa. Note that the lion comes first in the list, and that it is referred to as the "Magnanimous King of Beaʃt" (sic).
18th-century naturalists and authors compared the species' characters, generally in favor of the lion.[112] Oliver Goldsmith ranked the lion first among carnivorous mammals, followed by the tiger, which in his view "seems to partake of all the noxious qualities of the lion, without sharing any of his good ones. To pride, courage and strength, the lion joins greatness, clemency and generosity; but the tiger is fierce without provocation, and cruel without necessity."[113] Charles Knight, writing in The English Cyclopaedia, disparaged the opinions of naturalists Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and Thomas Pennant in this context, stating "the general herd of authors who eulogise the 'courage, greatness, clemency and generosity' of the lion, contrasting it with the unprovoked ferocity, unnecessary cruelty and poltroonery of the tiger, becomes ridiculous, though led by such names as Buffon and Pennant."[112]

English literature compared their battle strengths.[114] The poets Edmund Spenser, Allan Ramsey, and Robert Southey described lion victories.[114] In the view of a 19th-century literary critic, these contests established "sovereignty of the animal world."[114]
According to John Hampden Porter (1894, page 176), Lockington said that the jaguar reigned 'supreme' as the "terror of the forest," and that this applied to the lion and tiger in the 'desert' and 'jungle', respectively.[4]
In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Narada told Srinjaya that tigers were fiercer and more ruthless than lions.[115] This is in contrast with other literature from ancient India, which prefers the lion to the tiger. For example, Vedic literature depicted the lion, rather than the tiger, as the "king of the forest".[116]
The lion and tiger rival each other in Iranian literature.[117] For example, Humphreys and Kahrom, in their 1999 book Lion and Gazelle: The Mammals and Birds of Iran, treated them as the "two greatest and most beautiful" of Iranian carnivores, albeit being extinct there. As with the lion,[1] the tiger's Persian name was used for people and places.[12]
