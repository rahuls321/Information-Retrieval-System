In the theory of vector spaces,  a set of vectors is said to be linearly dependent if there is a nontrivial linear combination of the vectors that equals the zero vector. If no such linear combination exists, then the vectors are said to be linearly independent. These concepts are central to the definition of dimension.A vector space can be of finite dimension or infinite dimension depending on the maximum number of linearly independent vectors.  The definition of linear dependence and the ability to determine whether a subset of vectors in a vector space is linearly dependent are central to determining the dimension of a vector space.

In other words, a sequence of vectors is linearly independent if the only representation of                               0                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {0} }   as a linear combination of its vectors is the trivial representation in which all the scalars                               a                      i                                {\displaystyle a_{i}}   are zero. Even more concisely, a sequence of vectors is linearly independent if and only if                               0                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {0} }   can be represented as a linear combination of its vectors in a unique way. If a sequence of vectors contains twice the same vector, it is necessarily dependent. The linear dependency of a sequence of vectors does not depend of the order of the terms in the sequence. This allows defining linear independence for a finite set of vectors: A finite set of vectors is linearly independent if the sequence obtained by ordering them is linearly independent. In other words, one has the following result that is often useful.A sequence of vectors is linearly independent if  and only if it does not contain twice the same vector and the set of its vectors is linearly independent.= Infinite case =An infinite set of vectors is linearly independent if every nonempty finite subset is linearly independent. Conversely, an infinite set of vectors is linearly dependent if it contains a finite subset that is linearly dependent, or equivalently, if some vector in the set is a linear combination of other vectors in the set. An indexed family of vectors is linearly independent if it does not contain twice the same vector, and if the set of its vectors is linearly independent. Otherwise, the family is said linearly dependent.A set of vectors which is linearly independent and spans some vector space, forms a basis for that vector space. For example, the vector space of all polynomials in x over the reals has the (infinite) subset {1, x, x2, ...} as a basis.

The three vectors define a three-dimensional space.The vectors                                                         o              →                                            {\displaystyle {\vec {o}}}   (null vector, whose components are equal to zero) and                                                         k              →                                            {\displaystyle {\vec {k}}}   are dependent since                                                         o              →                                      =        0                                            k              →                                            {\displaystyle {\vec {o}}=0{\vec {k}}}  = Geographic location =A person describing the location of a certain place might say, "It is 3 miles north and 4 miles east of here."  This is sufficient information to describe the location, because the geographic coordinate system may be considered as a 2-dimensional vector space (ignoring altitude and the curvature of the Earth's surface).  The person might add, "The place is 5 miles northeast of here."  This last statement is true, but it is not necessary to find the location.    In this example the "3 miles north" vector and the "4 miles east" vector are linearly independent.  That is to say, the north vector cannot be described in terms of the east vector, and vice versa.  The third "5 miles northeast" vector is a linear combination of the other two vectors, and it makes the set of vectors linearly dependent, that is, one of the three vectors is unnecessary to define a specific location on a plane.Also note that if altitude is not ignored, it becomes necessary to add a third vector to the linearly independent set.  In general, n linearly independent vectors are required to describe all locations in n-dimensional space.

To see why, suppose that                     i              {\displaystyle i}   is an index (i.e. an element of                     {        1        ,        …        ,        k        }              {\displaystyle \{1,\ldots ,k\}}  ) such that                                           v                                i                          =                  0                .              {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{i}=\mathbf {0} .}   Then let                               a                      i                          :=        1              {\displaystyle a_{i}:=1}   (alternatively, letting                               a                      i                                {\displaystyle a_{i}}   be equal any other non-zero scalar will also work) and then let all other scalars be                     0              {\displaystyle 0}   (explicitly, this means that for any index                     j              {\displaystyle j}   other than                     i              {\displaystyle i}   (i.e. for                     j        ≠        i              {\displaystyle j\neq i}  ), let                               a                      j                          :=        0              {\displaystyle a_{j}:=0}   so that consequently                               a                      j                                                v                                j                          =        0                              v                                j                          =                  0                      {\displaystyle a_{j}\mathbf {v} _{j}=0\mathbf {v} _{j}=\mathbf {0} }  ). Simplifying                               a                      1                                                v                                1                          +        ⋯        +                  a                      k                                                v                                k                                {\displaystyle a_{1}\mathbf {v} _{1}+\cdots +a_{k}\mathbf {v} _{k}}   gives:                               a                      1                                                v                                1                          +        ⋯        +                  a                      k                                                v                                k                          =                  0                +        ⋯        +                  0                +                  a                      i                                                v                                i                          +                  0                +        ⋯        +                  0                =                  a                      i                                                v                                i                          =                  a                      i                                    0                =                  0                .              {\displaystyle a_{1}\mathbf {v} _{1}+\cdots +a_{k}\mathbf {v} _{k}=\mathbf {0} +\cdots +\mathbf {0} +a_{i}\mathbf {v} _{i}+\mathbf {0} +\cdots +\mathbf {0} =a_{i}\mathbf {v} _{i}=a_{i}\mathbf {0} =\mathbf {0} .}  Because not all scalars are zero (in particular,                               a                      i                          ≠        0              {\displaystyle a_{i}\neq 0}  ), this proves that the vectors                                           v                                1                          ,        …        ,                              v                                k                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1},\dots ,\mathbf {v} _{k}}   are linearly dependent. As a consequence, the zero vector can not possibly belong to any collection of vectors that is linearly independent. Now consider the special case where the sequence of                                           v                                1                          ,        …        ,                              v                                k                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1},\dots ,\mathbf {v} _{k}}   has length                     1              {\displaystyle 1}   (i.e. the case where                     k        =        1              {\displaystyle k=1}  ). A collection of vectors that consists of exactly one vector is linearly dependent if and only if that vector is zero. Explicitly, if                                           v                                1                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1}}   is any vector then the sequence                                           v                                1                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1}}   (which is a sequence of length                     1              {\displaystyle 1}  ) is linearly dependent if and only if                                           v                                1                          =                  0                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1}=\mathbf {0} }  ; alternatively, the collection                                           v                                1                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1}}   is linearly independent if and only if                                           v                                1                          ≠                  0                .              {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1}\neq \mathbf {0} .}  = Linear dependence and independence of two vectors =This example considers the special case where there are exactly two vector                               u                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }   and                               v                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }   from some real or complex vector space.

Consider the first                     m              {\displaystyle m}   rows of                     A              {\displaystyle A}  , the first                     m              {\displaystyle m}   equations; any solution of the full list of equations must also be true of the reduced list. In fact, if ⟨i1,...,im⟩ is any list of                     m              {\displaystyle m}   rows, then the equation must be true for those rows.                              A                      ⟨                          i                              1                                      ,            …            ,                          i                              m                                      ⟩                          Λ        =                  0                .              {\displaystyle A_{\langle i_{1},\dots ,i_{m}\rangle }\Lambda =\mathbf {0} .}  Furthermore, the reverse is true. That is, we can test whether the                     m              {\displaystyle m}   vectors are linearly dependent by testing whether                    det                  A                      ⟨                          i                              1                                      ,            …            ,                          i                              m                                      ⟩                          =        0              {\displaystyle \det A_{\langle i_{1},\dots ,i_{m}\rangle }=0}  for all possible lists of                     m              {\displaystyle m}   rows. (In case                     m        =        n              {\displaystyle m=n}  , this requires only one determinant, as above. If                     m        >        n              {\displaystyle m>n}  , then it is a theorem that the vectors must be linearly dependent.) This fact is valuable for theory; in practical calculations more efficient methods are available.= More vectors than dimensions =If there are more vectors than dimensions, the vectors are linearly dependent. This is illustrated in the example above of three vectors in                                           R                                2                          .              {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}.}   Natural basis vectors Let                     V        =                              R                                n                                {\displaystyle V=\mathbb {R} ^{n}}   and consider the following elements in                     V              {\displaystyle V}  , known as the natural basis vectors:                                                                                                              e                                                        1                                                                              =                                            (                1                ,                0                ,                0                ,                …                ,                0                )                                                                                                          e                                                        2                                                                              =                                            (                0                ,                1                ,                0                ,                …                ,                0                )                                                                                  ⋮                                                                                                          e                                                        n                                                                              =                                            (                0                ,                0                ,                0                ,                …                ,                1                )                .                                                          {\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}\mathbf {e} _{1}&=&(1,0,0,\ldots ,0)\\\mathbf {e} _{2}&=&(0,1,0,\ldots ,0)\\&\vdots \\\mathbf {e} _{n}&=&(0,0,0,\ldots ,1).\end{matrix}}}  Then                                           e                                1                          ,                              e                                2                          ,        …        ,                              e                                n                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{1},\mathbf {e} _{2},\ldots ,\mathbf {e} _{n}}   are linearly independent. Linear independence of functions Let                     V              {\displaystyle V}   be the vector space of all differentiable functions of a real variable                     t              {\displaystyle t}  .

Since                               e                      2            t                                {\displaystyle e^{2t}}   is not zero for some                     t              {\displaystyle t}  ,                     b        =        0.              {\displaystyle b=0.}   It follows that                     a        =        0              {\displaystyle a=0}   too. Therefore, according to the definition of linear independence,                               e                      t                                {\displaystyle e^{t}}   and                               e                      2            t                                {\displaystyle e^{2t}}   are linearly independent. Space of linear dependencies A linear dependency or linear relation among vectors v1, ..., vn is a tuple (a1, ..., an) with n scalar components such that                              a                      1                                                v                                1                          +        ⋯        +                  a                      n                                                v                                n                          =                  0                .              {\displaystyle a_{1}\mathbf {v} _{1}+\cdots +a_{n}\mathbf {v} _{n}=\mathbf {0} .}  If such a linear dependence exists with at least a nonzero component, then the n vectors are linearly dependent. Linear dependencies among v1, ..., vn form a vector space.If the vectors are expressed by their coordinates, then the linear dependencies are the solutions of a homogeneous system of linear equations, with the coordinates of the vectors as coefficients. A basis of the vector space of linear dependencies can therefore be computed by Gaussian elimination. Generalizations = Affine independence =A set of vectors is said to be affinely dependent if at least one of the vectors in the set can be defined as an affine combination of the others. Otherwise, the set is called affinely independent. Any affine combination is a linear combination; therefore every affinely dependent set is linearly dependent. Conversely, every linearly independent set is affinely independent.Consider a set of                     m              {\displaystyle m}   vectors                                           v                                1                          ,        …        ,                              v                                m                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {v} _{m}}   of size                     n              {\displaystyle n}   each, and consider the set of                     m              {\displaystyle m}   augmented vectors                               (                                    [                                                                                                                  1                                                                                                                                                                  v                                                                                1                                                                                                                                                          ]                        ,            …            ,                          [                                                                                                                  1                                                                                                                                                                  v                                                                                m                                                                                                                                                          ]                                )                      {\textstyle \left(\left[{\begin{smallmatrix}1\\\mathbf {v} _{1}\end{smallmatrix}}\right],\ldots ,\left[{\begin{smallmatrix}1\\\mathbf {v} _{m}\end{smallmatrix}}\right]\right)}   of size                     n        +        1              {\displaystyle n+1}   each.
