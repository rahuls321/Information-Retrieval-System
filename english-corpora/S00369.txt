Events[edit]
January[edit]
  10 January: The first successful xenogeneic heart transplant, from a genetically modified pig to a human patient, is reported.
1 January – Israel reports, for the first time, a case of flurona, a rare mixture of coronavirus and influenza infections.[1][2][3][4]
6 January
The global atmospheric methane concentration exceeds 1,900 parts per billion (ppb) for the first time in human history.[5]
Astronomers report the first direct detection of pre-supernova activity in a red supergiant star before a Type II supernova.[6][7]
10 January
The first successful xenogeneic heart transplant, from a genetically modified pig to a human patient, is reported in the United States.[8][9]
Researchers at the University of Montreal in Canada use DNA to make the world's tiniest antenna, designed to track the motion of proteins inside a cell.[10]
Researchers build upon previous studies documenting biodiversity loss to confirm that a sixth mass extinction event, entirely caused by anthropogenic activity, is currently underway.[11][12]
11 January – The first known deformation of an exoplanet is detected by the CHEOPS mission, which finds that WASP-103b is being strongly influenced by its parent star's close proximity, making the planet shaped like an ellipsoid instead of a sphere.[13]
12 January – A team at Stanford reports the fastest ever sequencing of a human genome, accomplished in just five hours and two minutes.[14]
13 January – NASA reports that Earth's global average surface temperature in 2021 was tied with 2018 as the sixth warmest on record, while the past eight years were collectively the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.[15]
18 January – Europe's first quantum annealer with more than 5,000 qubits is launched in Jülich, Germany.[16]
20 January – UNESCO announces a major new coral reef off the coast of Tahiti, stretching 3 km (1.9 mi) and in "pristine" condition, discovered by marine biologists as part of the Seabed 2030 Project.[17][18]
26 January
Scientists at Tufts University and the Wyss Institute regrow the missing legs of adult frogs, which are naturally unable to regenerate limbs, using a five-drug cocktail applied in a silicone wearable bioreactor.[19]
The first laparoscopic surgery performed entirely by a robot is reported at Johns Hopkins University.[20]
27 January – Astronomers at the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research report the discovery of a repeating transient with an unusually slow spin, occurring just three times an hour. It is believed to be a new class of neutron star or a white dwarf, located 4,000 light years away.[21]

Date unknown[edit]
March – The Large Hadron Collider is planned to recommence full operations.[22] The collider was shut down in December 2018 "to enable major upgrade and renovation works."[23]
June: Planned launch of ESA's JUICE spacecraft, which will explore Jupiter and its large ice-covered moons after a seven-year transit.[24]
August: NASA's Psyche spacecraft will be launched towards asteroid 16 Psyche.[25]
Late September: ESA's ExoMars rover Rosalind Franklin will be launched to Mars.[26]
Q3: The Indian Space Research Organisation plans to launch the Chandrayaan-3 Moon mission in the third quarter of 2022 (July to September 2022).[27]
