Periyar National Park (also known as Periyar Tiger Reserve, Thekkady) is in Northern and Central Travancore, in the state of Kerala, in India.


Understand[edit]
  Periyar national park
Periyar is a protected area, and a nature reserve in the South Indian State of Kerala, set high in the mountains of the Western Ghats at the border to Tamil Nadu. It lies in the districts of Idukki and Pathanamthitta. The protected area covers an area of 777 km², out of which a 350 km² part of the core zone was made into the Periyar National Park and Tiger Reserve, sometimes dubbed the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary

History[edit]
Before the core area was made into a National Park it was a wildlife sanctuary.

Landscape[edit]
Flora and fauna[edit]
Periyar is home to one of India's largest tiger populations. There are also gaur (Indian bison) and wild boar. Please note you will be need to be very lucky to see a tiger.

Climate[edit]
Since it is at a high altitude the climate is cooler than at the shore.

Get in[edit]
The only way to the tourism zone is through the gate at Thekkady, a few kilometers from Kumily. Kumily on the Tamil Nadu border is well connected to Kodaikanal, Madurai, Theni in Tamil Nadu and Kottayam in Kerala.

By bus[edit]
Private vehicles are not permitted in the park. Visitors must catch a bus from the ticket booth in Kumily (price included in entry fee). Buses depart every 10 minutes or so and drop you off at the boat ramp.

Fees and permits[edit]
Entrance to the park is ₹475 for foreigners which includes the bus to the boat ramp.

Do[edit]
Buy[edit]
Eat[edit]
Periyar is near a pepper-growing region. Try an omelette (or anything you can find) with crushed fresh peppercorns - nothing to beat it!

Drink[edit]
Sleep[edit]
The best way to experience Periyar is to stay in the treehouse. The ranger will escort you there around 10AM and come to collect you at the same time next day. It is just a wooden box, so bring your own bedding, candles, food etc. The treehouse is situated at the end of a tongue of grassy land with forest on either side. As the sun sets the animals all come out to graze (not the tigers though), and in the morning they are there again as the mist lifts. In between you can kick back, admire the view, listen to the orchestra of insects and birds, and amuse yourself with the graffiti collection.

Lodging[edit]
At the Bamboo Grove (it's an accommodation provided by the Kerala Forest Division).

Camping[edit]
Backcountry[edit]
Leeches are likely to attach themselves to your leg if you go on a bushwalk with one of the guides. Special canvas 'shoe covers' are available. Do not wander in the woods alone.
