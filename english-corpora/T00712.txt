Bandipur National Park was created in 1931 when it occupied 800 km2 of the total land of the Bandipur Reserve Forest. Following this, in 1973, the Bandipur Tiger Reserve was formed that has taken a great care of significant, but consistent increase in the number of tigers. In the historic days, the maharajas (kings) of the nearby Mysore city regarded the Bandipur forests as a private game reserve. Since its inception, as it is situated under the canopy of the Western Ghats, the Bandipur National Park is undoubtedly among the superb habitats for the Asian elephant and gaurs.

See[edit][add listing]Gopalswamy Betta[edit][add listing]  Gopalswamy BettaGopalswamy Betta is one of the highest peaks in the Bandipur National Park and location of an ancient (13th-century) fort of the Palegars of Terakanambi.
The view from top of this hill is truly breath-taking. It is one of the highest peaks (1454 meters above sea level) in the Bandipur National Park, Karnataka, India. It is also called Himada Gopalswamy Betta, as it is covered in mist (hima means mist in Kannada), for most of the months. (Betta means hill in Kannada). Another attraction at this peak is the fabled perpetual wind, that greets anyone who cares to climb it.
Herds of wild elephants are seen regularly near this peak. A lake, a few hundred feet below the peak serves as the local watering hole for the other wildlife.
The nearest town is Gundulpet, 20 km.
The nearest city is Mysore, 89 km.
There are no buses to Gopalswamy betta, so it would be prudent to take either a taxi, or ride a motorbike.
Take the NH-212 towards Gundulpet from Mysore. Just outside of Gundulpet there is a fork in the road. One towards Sultan Bateri, Waynad (NH-212 continued) and the other towards Bandipur (NH-66). Take the fork towards Bandipur. As you proceed towards Bandipur, take a right turn at Hangala village. (There should be a big Karnataka Tourism board abutting the road). From this point, the hill top should be 15 km. 4 km further, there is a forest department check post at the base of the hill. It is a 10 km winding, steep road, with a few hairpin bends that take you to the hill top.
There is an entrance fee that needs to be paid at the forest department check post. The fees varies depending on type of vehicle you intended to climb the hill.
Two wheeler ₹25 and car ₹50.
Camping is possible, with the permission of the Range officer, at the Bandipur National Park. A travellers' bungalow is also available, but it has no running water. Again, the permission of the Range Officer is required.

If you are driving by and see some wildlife, do not lower your windshield when you stop your car, you'll have attracted some fearless monkeys which will enter your vehicle and not leave until it finds something to eat. Try not to feed the animals.
