General administration[edit]
The Gautam Budh Nagar district is a part of Meerut division, headed by the Divisional Commissioner, who is an IAS officer of high seniority, the Commissioner is the head of local government institutions (including Municipal Corporations) in the division, is in-charge of infrastructure development in his division, and is also responsible for maintaining law and order in the division.[21][22][23][24][25] The District Magistrate, hence, reports to the Divisional Commissioner of Meerut.

Politics[edit]

Infrastructure[edit]
Noida stands at 17th place when it comes to cleanliness among cities in India.[37] The creation of associated physical infrastructure is higher in Noida and Greater Noida.[38] Most of the land in Noida is not very fertile and the agricultural output is low. It is in the flood plains of the Yamuna River on one side and the Hindon River on the other. Many villages are visible from the Noida Expressway, beginning from the Mahamaya flyover to Greater Noida on both sides. One end of the Taj expressway terminates on Noida Expressway near the Hindon River and the other at Agra. Up until the 1980s, these villages were flooded every 2–3 years, resulting in people temporarily moving to other places in Noida, and even as far as Mehrauli in Delhi. Noida is also famous for its tall buildings and comes 2nd in India after Mumbai in this parameter.[citation needed]
There is always a huge amount of revenue surplus each year as they are unable to spend the entire amount on development or on maintaining civic amenities. Lease rent and interest from builders are the biggest contributors to Noida's revenue. Besides, the authority gets huge revenues out of water and property transfer charges. "The Noida authority had deposited ₹3,500 crore as fixed deposits in various banks because of surplus funds. Noida has so much surplus funds with it that it can run the city even if it does not take any taxes from its allottees for 5 years in a row."[39]
A 300 m (980 ft) tall skyscraper named "Supernova Spira" is under in Noida.[40] It will be the tallest residential tower in northern India after its completion in 2021.[41]

Scientists are giving a new lease of life to endangered and extinct plant species at the Botanical Garden. A look around the green expanse reveals species like Psilotum Nudum, better known as skeleton fork fern. Considered a "primitive" plant – a descendant of possibly the first group of vascular plants from 400 million years ago – that was widespread during the Devonian and Silurian periods – its name means "bare naked" in Latin as it lacks most of the organs found in plants species that evolved later.[49][50]
Noida's botanical garden is divided into 10 sections. The "medicinal plants" section has an astounding variety of 96 plants and is further divided into eight sections named after the parts of the human body they benefit. For example, the "digestive system" section has aloe vera and Gymnema sylvestre (madhunaashini), which treats diabetes.
The "blood and circulation" section has Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) and Aristolochia indica (Isharmul) - blood purifiers. The "musculo-skeletal" section has Cissus quadrangularis (Hadjod); "skin disease" section has Plumbago zeylanica (Chitarak) which cures leucoderma.
Noida's botanical garden has a large fruit section which has many varieties of mango, pomegranate, lemon, pear, plum, mulberry, etc., besides their speciality the black guava. The woodland section is equally impressive with trees like Sapindus Emarginatus (Reetha), Pterocarpus marsupium (Sandalwood), Dalbergia sissoo (Sheesham wood), and Tectona Grandis (Teakwood).[51]

Villages in Noida City[edit]

Noida originally consisted of around 81 villages, but now comes under the Gautam Buddh Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh.[63]
Still, Noida villages lack permanent postal and individual address but according to officials, the homes in villages will be soon mapped using aerial imagery captured by drones designed by North East Centre For Technology Application and Reach (NECTAR), an autonomous society set up under the Union government's department of science and technology. These maps will also provide crucial information about rural areas in an emergency. Officials said it will take almost a year to complete mapping and allotting addresses to all 81 villages.
With houses getting mapped and being allotted a formal address in Noida villages, procuring information on land rights, development plans, etc. will become easier. "Easily available maps will also be helpful in advancing development plans and settling disputes over bordering parcels of land. Mapping will also ease land transfers, by creating reliable maps and title documents."[63]
