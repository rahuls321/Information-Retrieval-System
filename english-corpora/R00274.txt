Tapirus is a genus which contains the three living American tapir species. The Malayan tapir is usually included in Tapirus as well, although some authorities have moved it into its own genus, Acrocodia.


== Extant species ==
The Kabomani tapir was at one point recognized as another living member of the genus, but is now considered to be nested within T. terrestris.


== Evolution ==
Tapirus first appeared in the Late Miocene in North America, with Tapirus webbi perhaps the oldest known fossil species.
Tapirus spread into South America and Eurasia during the Pliocene. It has been suggested that the tapirs that inhabited North America during the Late Pleistocene may be derived from a South American species that remigrated north, perhaps Tapirus cristatellus.Tapirs suffered large-scale extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene, and went completely extinct north of southern Mexico.
