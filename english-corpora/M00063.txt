In mathematics, the concept of a measure is a generalization of common notions such as mass, distance/length, area, volume, probability of events, and — after some adjustments — electrical charge. These seemingly distinct concepts are innately very similar and may, in many cases, be treated as mathematically indistinguishable. Measures are foundational in probability theory and advanced integration theory. Far-reaching generalizations of measure are widely used in quantum physics and physics in general.The intuition behind this concept dates back to Ancient Greece, when Archimedes tried to calculate the area of a circle. But it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that measure theory became a branch of mathematics. The foundations of modern measure theory were laid in the works of Émile Borel, Henri Lebesgue, Johann Radon, Constantin Carathéodory, and Maurice Fréchet, among others. Definition Let X be a set and Σ a σ-algebra over X. A function μ from Σ to the extended real number line is called a measure if it satisfies the following properties:Non-negativity: For all E in Σ, we have μ(E) ≥ 0.Null empty set:                     μ        (        ∅        )        =        0              {\displaystyle \mu (\varnothing )=0}  .Countable additivity (or σ-additivity): For all countable collections                     {                  E                      k                                    }                      k            =            1                                ∞                                {\displaystyle \{E_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty }}   of pairwise disjoint sets in Σ,If at least one set                     E              {\displaystyle E}   has finite measure, then the requirement that                     μ        (        ∅        )        =        0              {\displaystyle \mu (\varnothing )=0}   is met automatically. Indeed, by countable additivity,                    μ        (        E        )        =        μ        (        E        ∪        ∅        )        =        μ        (        E        )        +        μ        (        ∅        )        ,              {\displaystyle \mu (E)=\mu (E\cup \varnothing )=\mu (E)+\mu (\varnothing ),}  and therefore                     μ        (        ∅        )        =        0.              {\displaystyle \mu (\varnothing )=0.}  If the condition of non-negativity is omitted but the second and third of these conditions are met, and μ takes on at most one of the values ±∞, then μ is called a signed measure.A triple (X, Σ, μ) is called a measure space. A probability measure is a measure with total measure one – i.e. μ(X) = 1. A probability space is a measure space with a probability measure.For measure spaces that are also topological spaces various compatibility conditions can be placed for the measure and the topology. Most measures met in practice in analysis (and in many cases also in probability theory) are Radon measures. Radon measures have an alternative definition in terms of linear functionals on the locally convex space of continuous functions with compact support. This approach is taken by Bourbaki (2004) and a number of other sources. For more details, see the article on Radon measures. Instances Some important measures are listed here.The counting measure is defined by μ(S) = number of elements in S.The Lebesgue measure on ℝ is a complete translation-invariant measure on a σ-algebra containing the intervals in ℝ such that μ([0, 1]) = 1; and every other measure with these properties extends Lebesgue measure.Circular angle measure is invariant under rotation, and hyperbolic angle measure is invariant under squeeze mapping.The Haar measure for a locally compact topological group is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure (and also of counting measure and circular angle measure) and has similar uniqueness properties.The Hausdorff measure is a generalization of the Lebesgue measure to sets with non-integer dimension, in particular, fractal sets.Every probability space gives rise to a measure which takes the value 1 on the whole space (and therefore takes all its values in the unit interval [0, 1]). Such a measure is called a probability measure. See probability axioms.The Dirac measure δa (cf. Dirac delta function) is given by δa(S) = χS(a), where χS is the indicator function of S. The measure of a set is 1 if it contains the point a and 0 otherwise.Other 'named' measures used in various theories include: Borel measure, Jordan measure, ergodic measure, Gaussian measure, Baire measure, Radon measure, Young measure, and Loeb measure.In physics an example of a measure is spatial distribution of mass (see e.g., gravity potential), or another non-negative extensive property, conserved (see conservation law for a list of these) or not. Negative values lead to signed measures, see "generalizations" below.Liouville measure, known also as the natural volume form on a symplectic manifold, is useful in classical statistical and Hamiltonian mechanics.Gibbs measure is widely used in statistical mechanics, often under the name canonical ensemble.

For instance, for each n ∈ N, let En = [n, ∞) ⊂ R, which all have infinite Lebesgue measure, but the intersection is empty. Other properties = Completeness =A measurable set X is called a null set if μ(X) = 0. A subset of a null set is called a negligible set. A negligible set need not be measurable, but every measurable negligible set is automatically a null set. A measure is called complete if every negligible set is measurable.A measure can be extended to a complete one by considering the σ-algebra of subsets Y which differ by a negligible set from a measurable set X, that is, such that the symmetric difference of X and Y is contained in a null set. One defines μ(Y) to equal μ(X).= μ{x : f(x)≥t}=μ{x : f(x)>t} (a.e.) =If the                     μ              {\displaystyle \mu }  -measurable function                     f              {\displaystyle f}   takes values on                     [        0        ,        ∞        ]        ,              {\displaystyle [0,\infty ],}   then                    μ        {        x        :        f        (        x        )        ≥        t        }        =        μ        {        x        :        f        (        x        )        >        t        }        ,              {\displaystyle \mu \{x:f(x)\geq t\}=\mu \{x:f(x)>t\},}  for almost all                     t        ∈                  R                ,              {\displaystyle t\in \mathbb {R} ,}   with respect to the Lebesgue measure. This property is used in connection with Lebesgue integral.= Additivity =Measures are required to be countably additive. However, the condition can be strengthened as follows.For any set                     I              {\displaystyle I}   and any set of nonnegative                               r                      i                          ,        i        ∈        I              {\displaystyle r_{i},i\in I}   define:                              ∑                      i            ∈            I                                    r                      i                          =        sup                  {                                    ∑                              i                ∈                J                                                    r                              i                                      :                          |                        J                          |                        <                          ℵ                              0                                      ,            J            ⊆            I                    }                .              {\displaystyle \sum _{i\in I}r_{i}=\sup \left\lbrace \sum _{i\in J}r_{i}:|J|<\aleph _{0},J\subseteq I\right\rbrace .}  That is, we define the sum of the                               r                      i                                {\displaystyle r_{i}}   to be the supremum of all the sums of finitely many of them.A measure                     μ              {\displaystyle \mu }   on                     Σ              {\displaystyle \Sigma }   is                     κ              {\displaystyle \kappa }  -additive if for any                     λ        <        κ              {\displaystyle \lambda <\kappa }   and any family of disjoint sets                               X                      α                          ,        α        <        λ              {\displaystyle X_{\alpha },\alpha <\lambda }   the following hold:                              ⋃                      α            ∈            λ                                    X                      α                          ∈        Σ              {\displaystyle \bigcup _{\alpha \in \lambda }X_{\alpha }\in \Sigma }                      μ                  (                                    ⋃                              α                ∈                λ                                                    X                              α                                              )                =                  ∑                      α            ∈            λ                          μ                  (                      X                          α                                )                .              {\displaystyle \mu \left(\bigcup _{\alpha \in \lambda }X_{\alpha }\right)=\sum _{\alpha \in \lambda }\mu \left(X_{\alpha }\right).}  Note that the second condition is equivalent to the statement that the ideal of null sets is                     κ              {\displaystyle \kappa }  -complete.= Sigma-finite measures =A measure space (X, Σ, μ) is called finite if μ(X) is a finite real number (rather than ∞). Nonzero finite measures are analogous to probability measures in the sense that any finite measure μ is proportional to the probability measure                                           1                          μ              (              X              )                                      μ              {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\mu (X)}}\mu }  . A measure μ is called σ-finite if X can be decomposed into a countable union of measurable sets of finite measure. Analogously, a set in a measure space is said to have a σ-finite measure if it is a countable union of sets with finite measure.For example, the real numbers with the standard Lebesgue measure are σ-finite but not finite. Consider the closed intervals [k, k+1] for all integers k; there are countably many such intervals, each has measure 1, and their union is the entire real line. Alternatively, consider the real numbers with the counting measure, which assigns to each finite set of reals the number of points in the set. This measure space is not σ-finite, because every set with finite measure contains only finitely many points, and it would take uncountably many such sets to cover the entire real line. The σ-finite measure spaces have some very convenient properties; σ-finiteness can be compared in this respect to the Lindelöf property of topological spaces. They can be also thought of as a vague generalization of the idea that a measure space may have 'uncountable measure'.= s-finite measures =A measure is said to be s-finite if it is a countable sum of bounded measures. S-finite measures are more general than sigma-finite ones and have applications in the theory of stochastic processes. Non-measurable sets If the axiom of choice is assumed to be true, it can be proved that not all subsets of Euclidean space are Lebesgue measurable; examples of such sets include the Vitali set, and the non-measurable sets postulated by the Hausdorff paradox and the Banach–Tarski paradox. Generalizations For certain purposes, it is useful to have a "measure" whose values are not restricted to the non-negative reals or infinity. For instance, a countably additive set function with values in the (signed) real numbers is called a signed measure, while such a function with values in the complex numbers is called a complex measure. Observe, however, that complex measure is necessarily of finite variation, hence complex measures include finite signed measures but not, for example, the Lebesgue measure.Measures that take values in Banach spaces have been studied extensively. A measure that takes values in the set of self-adjoint projections on a Hilbert space is called a projection-valued measure; these are used in functional analysis for the spectral theorem. When it is necessary to distinguish the usual measures which take non-negative values from generalizations, the term positive measure is used. Positive measures are closed under conical combination but not general linear combination, while signed measures are the linear closure of positive measures.Another generalization is the finitely additive measure, also known as a content. This is the same as a measure except that instead of requiring countable additivity we require only finite additivity. Historically, this definition was used first. It turns out that in general, finitely additive measures are connected with notions such as Banach limits, the dual of L∞ and the Stone–Čech compactification. All these are linked in one way or another to the axiom of choice.  Contents remain useful in certain technical problems in geometric measure theory; this is the theory of Banach measures.A charge is a generalization in both directions: it is a finitely additive, signed measure.
