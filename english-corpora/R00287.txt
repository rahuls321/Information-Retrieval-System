Battle of Chach, was fought in 1008 AD between the Ghaznavid army of Sultan Mahmud bin Sebuktigin (Mahmud of Ghazni) and the Hindu Shahi army of Anandapala, near Hazro, resulting in the latter's defeat. This left the north Indian region vulnerable to further invasions.


== Background ==
He might have called upon the nearby friendly rulers to send their contingents.


== Battle ==
The massive army of the allied forces held the Ghaznavids at the bank of Indus River. The invaders faced huge resistance at a place near Hazro called Chukhsa or Chach. The role of a local tribe was very significant in this battle because it managed to annihilate a huge cavalry force of Ghaznavids who were fighting as the vanguard. The tribe was known to be the Ghakar tribe. When the allied forces were moving forward to engage the enemy, the latter threw big fireballs at the elephants which frenzied them and caused them to crush their own troops, turning it into a victory for the invaders. Consequently, the rest of India came under Muslim rule for almost 400 years. Ghazni won the battle and Anandapala had to cede the territory and its treasures.
