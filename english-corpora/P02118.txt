Summoning all the monkeys, that foremost of monkeys, king Sugriva, spoke to them all touching the success of Rāma's work. The monkey-chiefs, knowing the stern command of their lord should search in all these places. Then, covering up the earth like locusts, they marched away. Expecting tidings of Sītä, Rāma remained that month in the vicinity of that cascade, in company with Lakşmaņa. And that heroic monkey Satavali swiftly set out for the northern regions covered by the monarch of mountains. And that leader of monkey herds, Vinata, proceeded towards the estern quarter. And that monkey, Hanumān-leader of monkeyherds in company with Tārā, Angada and others, went to the South, inhabited by Agastya. And that lord of monkeys, Suşeņa, lion among monkeys, went to the terrible western quarter, protected by Varuna. Then, having properly despatched (his forces) in all directions, that general of the monkey hosts, being pleased, gave himself up to sport. Thus despatched by the king, the monkeychiefs proceeded apace respectively towards their destined quarters. And the monkeys possessed of great strength cried and howled and roared and shouted and rushed and sent up loud ululations. Thus despatched by the king, the leaders of monkeyherds, said, We shall bring back Sītā, and slay Rāvana. I alone shall slay Răvaņa engaged in conflict. And slaying (him), I shall this very day swiftly carry off Janaka's daughter, trembling because of fatigue, (saying to her), 'Rest you. I single-handed shall recover Jānakī even from the nether regions. I shall uproot trees and rive mountains. I shall cleave the earth and vex the deep. (And some said), I can, without doubt, clear a Yojana at one bound; and another said, I can clear and hundred; and a yet another, I can more than an hundred. And neither on earth, nor in sea, mountains, woods, nor nether regions can my course be obstructed. Thus did the apes proud of their strength, severally speak in presence of the sovereign of the monkeys.
