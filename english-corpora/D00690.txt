Education and medical career[edit]
Nowzaradan was born and raised in Tehran, Iran, and is an Assyrian.[4][5] In 1970, he graduated from the University of Tehran with a Doctor of Medicine degree.[6] He then moved to the United States. He participated in the Medical Orientation Program at Saint Louis University in 1971 and completed a Rotating Surgical Internship at St. John Hospital (operated by St. John Providence Health System) in Detroit, Michigan.[6] Nowzaradan is a fellow of the American College of Surgeons.
Nowzaradan is currently affiliated with Houston Obesity Surgery in Houston, TX and practices at several local hospitals.[6]  He is  the author of several scholarly publications on obesity and laparoscopy.[7] According to the Web of Science, he has published five papers.[8][9][10][11][12] 

Accusations of malpractice[edit]
In 2007, Colleen Shepard sued Nowzaradan after the death of her daughter Tina Shepard. She claimed Nowzaradan failed to inform her daughter of the risks involved with a gastric bypass surgery. Shepard died one year after her procedure from complications of liver failure and blood poisoning. The lawsuit also stated that proper aftercare was not provided. Nowzaradan stated, "We called and called her to make follow-up appointments, and she said she would come in, but she never showed up."[13]
In 2012, a deceased patient's spouse filed a lawsuit claiming that Nowzaradan and the hospital he worked at failed to properly diagnose the severity of her husband's condition, which ultimately led to his death after a procedure. Nowzaradan denied the allegations and the lawsuit was dropped a little over a year later.[citation needed]
Again in 2012, Michelle Park sued Nowzaradan and his anesthesiologist for malpractice. She claimed Nowzaradan left a 6.69 inch piece of tubing during a procedure, and that the tubing ended up puncturing her colon. The suit was dismissed for unknown reasons. Nowzaradan claimed, "The lawsuit against me was dismissed because I was not the one who left the tube."[14]
In June 2017, Nowzaradan was sued for $250,000,000 by a patient, claiming that he botched their abdominoplasty. He also claimed that the botched procedure left a "deformed abdomen," and "extreme pain." In 2018, a request to dismiss the suit was filed by the accuser.[14]
In September 2017, a 72-year-old woman sued Nowzaradan claiming he left a stainless steel connector and tubing inside her. She is seeking compensation between $200,000 and $1,000,000. Nowzaradan denies the allegations.[15]

Media appearances[edit]
He has been on My 600-lb Life since 2012.[16] He has also appeared on installments of Body Shock, including the episodes "Half Ton Dad", "Half Ton Teen", and "Half Ton Mum".[16] He also published two books titled Last Chance to Live (2017).[17] & The Scale Does Not Lie, People Do (2019).[18] Dr. Now made several appearances at Texas theme parks such as Six Flags Astroworld to promote health awareness in the early 2000s, reaching out to youth, encouraging them to make good dietary choices.

Personal life[edit]
He was married to Delores McRedmond for 27 years; they divorced in 2002. The couple had three children together.[19] His son, Jonathan Nowzaradan (b. 1978), works as a director and producer for My 600-lb Life.[20][21]
