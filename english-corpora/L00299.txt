The International Booker Prize (formerly known as the Man Booker International Prize) is an international literary award hosted in the United Kingdom. The introduction of the International Prize to complement the Man Booker Prize was announced in June 2004.[1] Sponsored by the Man Group, from 2005 until 2015 the award was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation.[2] It rewarded one author's "continued creativity, development and overall contribution to fiction on the world stage",[3] and was a recognition of the writer's body of work rather than any one title.
Since 2016, the award has been given annually to a single book  translated into English and published in the United Kingdom or Ireland, with a £50,000 prize for the winning title, shared equally between author and translator.[4][5]
Crankstart, the charitable foundation of Sir Michael Moritz and his wife, Harriet Heyman began supporting The Booker Prizes on 1 June 2019. From this date, the prizes will be known as The Booker Prize and The International Booker Prize. Of their support for The Booker Prize Foundation and the prizes, Moritz commented: "Neither of us can imagine a day where we don’t spend time reading a book. The Booker Prizes are ways of spreading the word about the insights, discoveries, pleasures and joy that spring from great fiction".

History[edit]
Pre-2016[edit]
Whereas the Man Booker Prize was open only to writers from the Commonwealth, Ireland, and Zimbabwe, the International Prize was open to all nationalities who had work available in English including translations.[6] The award was worth £60,000 and given every two years to a living author's entire body of literature, similar to the Nobel Prize for Literature.[3] The Man Booker International Prize also allowed for a separate award for translation. If applicable, the winning author could choose their translators to receive a prize sum of £15,000.[7] 
The 2005 inaugural winner of the prize was Albanian writer Ismail Kadare. Praising its concerted judgement, the journalist Hephzibah Anderson noted that the Man Booker International Prize was "fast becoming the more significant award, appearing an ever more competent alternative to the Nobel".[8]

2016 onwards[edit]
In July 2015 it was announced that the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize would be disbanded.[5] The prize money from that award would be folded into the Man Booker International Prize, which would henceforth act similarly to the Independent prize: awarding an annual book of fiction translated into English, with the £50,000 prize split between author and translator.[9] Each shortlisted author and translator receives £1,000. Its aim is to encourage publishing and reading of quality works in translation and to highlight the work of translators. Judges select a longlist of ten books in March, followed by a shortlist of five in April, with the winner announced in May.[10]

Any writer has to gawk when reading her because her work is very subtle and precise. Her thoughtfulness about every subject is so concentrated."[13] Munro, who said she was "totally amazed and delighted" at her win, received the award at Trinity College, Dublin on 25 June.[2][13]

2011[edit]
The 2011 prize was judged by Rick Gekoski (Chair), Carmen Callil (withdrew in protest over choice of winner) and Justin Cartwright.[17] The nominees for the fourth Man Booker International Prize were announced on 30 March 2011 at a ceremony in Sydney, Australia.[18] John le Carré asked to be removed from consideration, saying he was "flattered", but that he does not compete for literary prizes.[19] However, judge Dr Rick Gekoski said although he was disappointed that le Carré wanted to withdraw, his name would remain on the list.[19] American novelist Roth was announced as the winner on 18 May 2011 at the Sydney Writers' Festival.[20] Of his win, Roth said "This is a great honour and I'm delighted to receive it."[20] The writer said he hoped the prize would bring him to the attention of readers around the world who are not currently familiar with his body of work.[20] Roth received his award in London on 28 June; however, he was unable to attend in person due to ill health, so he sent a short video instead.[20][21] After Roth was announced as the winner, Carmen Callil withdrew from the judging panel, saying "I don't rate him as a writer at all... in 20 years' time will anyone read him?" Callil later wrote an editorial in The Guardian explaining her position and why she chose to leave the panel.[7][22]

Judging panel chair Christopher Ricks commented that "There is vigilance to her stories, and great imaginative attention. Vigilance as how to realise things down to the very word or syllable; vigilance as to everybody's impure motives and illusions of feeling."[26]

2016[edit]
The 2016 prize was judged by Boyd Tonkin (Chair), Tahmima Anam, David Bellos, Daniel Medin and Ruth Padel.[30] The nominees for the seventh Man Booker International Prize were announced on 14 April 2016.[31] The six nominees were chosen from a longlist of thirteen.[30][32] Han became the first Korean author to win the prize and, under the new format for 2016, Smith became the first translator to share the prize. British journalist Boyd Tonkin, who chaired the judging panel, said that the decision was unanimous. He also said of the book "in a style both lyrical and lacerating, it reveals the impact of this great refusal both on the heroine herself and on those around her. This compact, exquisite and disturbing book will linger long in the minds, and maybe the dreams, of its readers."[33]

Nick Barley, who is the director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, described the book as "an ambitious high-wire act of a novel [that] shines a spotlight on the effects of grief, without any hint of sentimentality. The central character is challenging and flawed, but completely compelling." The novel won over 126 other contenders.[36]
