Premise[edit]
Vampirina follows the story of Vampirina "Vee" Hauntley who becomes the new kid on the block after she and her family move from Transylvania to Pennsylvania to open a local bed and breakfast called the Scare B&B for visiting ghouls (including vampires[2]) and goblins. The Hauntley family have to learn to do things the "Pennsylvania way," especially when Vee is at school, all while keeping their monster lives a secret from humans so they don't scare them.

Characters[edit]
Main[edit]
Vampirina "Vee" Hauntley (voiced by Isabella Crovetti) [3] –  A physically 8-year-old vampire, but biologically near 200 years old as stated in "Countess Vee". Unlike in the books, in the TV adaptation she and her family have blue skin and super-speed.[4] She is the lead singer and spookylele player of her band, the Ghoul Girls.
Boris and Oxana Hauntley (voiced by James Van Der Beek, and Lauren Graham, and voiced by Dan Green and Jules de Jongh respectively)[3] –  Vee's parents who are the proprietors of the Scare B&B.
Demi (voiced by Mitchell Whitfield) –  A blue ghost who lives with the Hauntleys. He is Vee and Gregoria's sidekick.
Gregoria[3] (voiced by Wanda Sykes) –  A 473-year-old gargoyle who is Vee's sidekick.
Poppy Peepleson (voiced by Jordan Alexa Davis and Amy Palant) –  Edna's daughter who is Vee's best friend. She is the first human who discovers Vee's true identity, but promises not to tell anyone. She's the drummer and the youngest of the Ghoul Girls. She is 8-years-old. In "Double Double Halloween Trouble", she and her family are revealed to be Hispanic. Her first name is probably chosen as a reference to Gothic author Billy Martin's pen name Poppy Z. Brite (cf. her brother's first name being that of Edgar Allan Poe).
Bridget (voiced by ViviAnn Yee) –  A very shy and nervous girl who is another one of Vee's friends. She also soon discovers Vee's identity, and like Poppy, promises to keep it secret. She has a pet Sphynx cat named Miss Cuddlecakes. She's the bassist and the smartest of the Ghoul Girls. She is also 9-years-old. She is revealed to be partly Jewish in "Double Double Halloween Trouble".
Edgar Peepleson (voiced by Benji Risley) –  Poppy's older twin brother who is a monster enthusiast and runs a vlog called "Weekly Weirdness". In the Season 2 finale episode "Ghoul Guides Save the Day!", he finally learns Vee's secret of her family being vampires, and the fact that monsters are actually real when he visits Vee's home town, Transylvania for the first time. However, just like Poppy and Bridget, he promises not to tell anyone. He is the percussionist and twin member of the Ghoul Girls. He is 8-years-old. Similarly to his sister, Edgar's first name is probably chosen as a reference to a Gothic author - namely Edgar Allan Poe.
Supporting[edit]
Chef Remy Bones (voiced by Ian James Corlett) –  A skeleton who is the head chef of the Scare B&B. He speaks with a French accent.
Wolfie (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) –  A purple dog who is the Hauntley's house pet. He can assume a werewolf-like form during a full moon or by drinking milk.
Edna Peepleson (voiced by Cree Summer)[3] –  Poppy and Edgar's mom.
Recurring[edit]
Grandpop and Nanpire (voiced by Brian Stokes Mitchell and Patti LuPone respectively)[3] –  Vee's grandparents.
Mr. Gore (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) –  Vee's human school teacher.
Guests[edit]
Cosmina and Narccissa (voiced by Alex Ellis and Laraine Newman respectively) –  Two 800-year old internet-using vampire sisters who were guests at the Scare B&B.
King Pepi (voiced by Andrew Rannells) – A mummy from Egypt.
Aunt Olga (voiced by Kari Wahlgren) – Vampirina's aunt, Nosy’s mother, Oxana’s sister and Boris’ sister-in-law.
Nosferatu "Nosy" (voiced by Kari Wahlgren) – Olga’s baby daughter and Vampirina's baby cousin.
Matilda (voiced by Lara Jill Miller) – A cuddly Snugglot monster.
Mr. Froufington (voiced by Phil LaMarr) – A foodie who visits the Scare B&B to try Oxana's food.
Phoebe (voiced by Sanai Victoria) – A little witch who first appears in "The Little Witch".
The Scream Girls – Vee's favorite goulish rock band.
FrankenStacy (voiced by Kaley Snider)
Creepy Caroline (voiced by Raini Rodriguez)
Ghastly Gayle (voiced by Gabriela Milo)
Buttons (voiced by Nika Futterman) – A blue Cuddle Monster.
Hornadette and Shriekia (voiced by Georgie Kidder and Debi Derryberry respectively) – A two-headed monster whose two heads are sisters.
Rusty Topsail (voiced by Christian Borle) – A ghost pirate.
Trevor Rider (voiced by Patrick Warburton) – A rodeo enthusiast and business mogul who sometimes helps with anything the Hauntleys need. He also has a soft side toward young kids like Vee.
Bob Bigfoot (voiced by Ethan Suplee) – An old friend of Boris who is often called "Uncle Bob" by Vee.
Poltergeist Pat (voiced by Adam DeVine) - An unscrupulous singer.
Frankenstein (voiced by Skylar Astin) - An old friend of Boris who tends to forget things.
Bride of Frankenstein (voiced by Anna Camp) - The girlfriend of Frankenstein who gets engaged to him.
