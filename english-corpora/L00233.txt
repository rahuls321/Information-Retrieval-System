Early life and education[edit]
Saunders was born in Amarillo, Texas. He grew up in Oak Forest, Illinois near Chicago, attended St. Damian Catholic School and graduated from Oak Forest High School in Oak Forest, Illinois. In 1981, he received a B.S. in geophysical engineering from Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado. Of his scientific background, Saunders has said, "... any claim I might make to originality in my fiction is really just the result of this odd background: basically, just me working inefficiently, with flawed tools, in a mode I don't have sufficient background to really understand. Like if you put a welder to designing dresses."[10]
In 1988, he was awarded an M.A. in creative writing from Syracuse University; while there, he met Paula Redick, a fellow writer, who would become his wife. Saunders recalled, "we [got] engaged in three weeks, a Syracuse Creative Writing Program record that, I believe, still stands."[1]
Regarding his influences, Saunders has written:

.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}I really love Russian writers, especially from the 19th and early 20th Century: Gogol, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Babel. I love the way they take on the big topics. I'm also inspired by a certain absurdist comic tradition that would include influences like Mark Twain, Daniil Kharms, Groucho Marx, Monty Python, Steve Martin, Jack Handey, etc. And then, on top of that, I love the strain of minimalist American fiction writing: Sherwood Anderson, Ernest Hemingway, Raymond Carver, Tobias Wolff.[11]
Career[edit]
Background and work[edit]
From 1989 to 1996, Saunders worked as a technical writer and geophysical engineer for Radian International, an environmental engineering firm in Rochester, New York. He also worked for a time with an oil exploration crew in Sumatra in the early 1980s.[12]
Since 1997, Saunders has been on the faculty of Syracuse University, teaching creative writing in the school's MFA program while continuing to publish fiction and non-fiction. In 2006, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and a $500,000 MacArthur Fellowship. He was a Visiting Writer at Wesleyan University and Hope College in 2010 and participated in Wesleyan's Distinguished Writers Series and Hope College's Visiting Writers Series. His non-fiction collection, The Braindead Megaphone, was published in 2007.[13]
Saunders's fiction often focuses on the absurdity of consumerism, corporate culture, and the role of mass media. While many reviewers mention his writing's satirical tone, his work also raises moral and philosophical questions. The tragicomic element in his writing has earned Saunders comparisons to Kurt Vonnegut, whose work has inspired him.[14]
The film rights to CivilWarLand in Bad Decline were purchased by Ben Stiller in the late 1990s; as of 2007[update], the project was in development by Stiller's company, Red Hour Productions.[15] Saunders has also written a feature-length screenplay based on his short story "Sea Oak".[16]
Saunders considered himself an Objectivist in his twenties but now views the philosophy unfavorably, likening it to neoconservatism.[17] He is now a student of Nyingma Buddhism.[2]

Awards[edit]
Saunders has won the National Magazine Award for Fiction four times: in 1994, for "The 400-Pound CEO" (published in Harper's); in 1996, for "Bounty" (also published in Harper's); in 2000, for "The Barber's Unhappiness" (published in The New Yorker); and in 2004, for "The Red Bow" (published in Esquire).[18] Saunders won second prize in the 1997 O. Henry Awards for his short story "The Falls", initially published in the January 22, 1996 issue of The New Yorker.[19][20]
His first short-story collection, CivilWarLand in Bad Decline, was a finalist for the 1996 PEN/Hemingway Award.[21]
In 2001, Saunders received a Lannan Literary Fellowship in Fiction from the Lannan Foundation.[22]
In 2006, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation.[23] That same year, he received a MacArthur Fellowship.[24] His short-story collection In Persuasion Nation was a finalist for The Story Prize in 2006.[25] In 2006, he also won the World Fantasy Award for Best Short Story for his short story "CommComm", first published in the August 1, 2005 issue of The New Yorker.[26][4]
In 2009, Saunders received an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[27][28] In 2014, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[29]
In 2013, Saunders won the PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in the Short Story.[30] His short-story collection Tenth of December won the 2013 Story Prize.[6] The collection also won the inaugural Folio Prize in 2014, "the first major English-language book prize open to writers from around the world."[7][31][32][8] The collection was also a finalist for the National Book Award,[33] and was named one of the "10 Best Books of 2013" by the editors of the New York Times Book Review.[34]
In a January 2013 cover story, The New York Times Magazine called Tenth of December "the best book you'll read this year."[35] One of the stories from the collection, "Home", was a 2011 Bram Stoker Award finalist.[36]
In 2017, Saunders published his first novel, Lincoln in the Bardo, which won the Man Booker Prize and was a New York Times bestseller.

^ In the "Author's Note" to the 2012 paperback reprint of CivilWarLand in Bad Decline, Saunders writes about an early story he published in 1986, titled "A Lack of Order in the Floating Object Room," which he (quote): "used it to get into Syracuse. This story was originally published in Northwest Review, Volume 24, Number 2, in 1986."
