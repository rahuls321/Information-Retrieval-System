A[edit]

ab initio
A mathematical model which seeks to describe atomic nuclei by solving the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation for all constituent nucleons and the forces that exist between them. Such methods yield precise results for very light nuclei but become more approximate for heavier nuclei.

Abbe number

In optics and lens design, a measure of a transparent material's dispersion (a variation of refractive index versus wavelength). High values of V indicate low dispersion.

absolute electrode potential
In electrochemistry, the electrode potential of a metal measured with respect to a universal reference system (without any additional metal–solution interface).

absolute humidity
The ratio of the water vapor in a sample of air to the volume of the sample.

absolute motion


absolute pressure
Is zero-referenced against a perfect vacuum, using an absolute scale, so it is equal to gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure.

absolute scale
Any system of measurement that begins at a minimum, or zero point, and progresses in only one direction. The zero point of an absolute scale is a natural minimum, leaving only one direction in which to progress, whereas an arbitrary or "relative" scale begins at some point selected by a person and can progress in both directions.

absolute zero
The theoretical lowest possible temperature, understood by international agreement as equivalent to 0 Kelvin or −273.15 °C (−459.67 °F). More formally, it is the theoretical lower limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, at which enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum values and the fundamental particles of nature have minimal vibrational motion.

absorption spectroscopy
Any of various spectroscopic techniques that measure the absorption of electromagnetic radiation due to its interaction with a sample. The sample absorbs energy, i.e. photons, from the radiating field. The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency or wavelength, and this variation is the absorption spectrum. Absorption spectroscopy is performed across the electromagnetic spectrum.

absorptivity

adhesion
The tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another. Contrast cohesion.

adiabatic cooling


adiabatic heating


adiabatic process
A process which occurs without transfer of heat or mass of substances between a thermodynamic system and its surroundings. In an adiabatic process, energy is transferred to the surroundings only as work.[5][6] The adiabatic process provides a rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the first law of thermodynamics, and as such it is a key concept in thermodynamics.

aerodynamics
The study of the motion of air, particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an airplane wing. It is a sub-field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics, and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields.

afocal system
An optical system that produces no net convergence or divergence of the beam, i.e. has an infinite effective focal length.[7] This type of system can be created with a pair of optical elements where the distance between the elements is equal to the sum of each element's focal length (

).

air mass
1.  In meteorology, a volume of air that is defined by its temperature and water vapor content. Air masses may cover many hundreds or thousands of square miles and generally adapt to the characteristics of the surface below them. They are often classified according to their latitude and their source regions.
2.  In astronomy, the "amount of air that one is looking through"[8] when observing a star or other celestial source from a vantage point that is within Earth's atmosphere. It is formulated as the integral of air density along the light ray.

air mass coefficient
Defines the direct optical path length through the Earth's atmosphere, expressed as a ratio relative to the path length vertically upwards, i.e. at the zenith. The air mass coefficient can be used to help characterize the solar spectrum after solar radiation has traveled through the atmosphere.

albedo
The fraction of the total light incident on a reflecting surface, especially a celestial body, which is reflected back in all directions.

alloy
A chemical mixture of a metal with one or more other metals or other elements.

alpha decay
Also α-decay.
A type of radioactive decay in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle and thereby transforms or "decays" into a different atomic nucleus, with a mass number that is reduced by four and an atomic number that is reduced by two.

alpha particle (α)
Also symbolized by α2+, He2+, and 42He2+.
A type of subatomic particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons bound together into a particle identical to the nucleus of a helium-4 ion. It has a charge of +2 e and a mass of 4 u. Alpha particles are classically produced in the process of radioactive alpha decay, but may also be produced in other ways and given the same name.

alternating current (AC)
A form of electric current in which the movement of electric charge periodically reverses direction. Contrast direct current.

ammeter
An instrument that is used to measure electric current.

amorphous solid
A type of solid which does not have a definite geometric shape.

ampere (A)
Often abbreviated as amp.
The SI base unit of electric current, defined as one coulomb of electric charge per second.

amplifier
Also electronic amplifier or (informally) amp.
An electronic device that can increase the power of a signal (a time-varying voltage or current). It is a two-port electronic circuit that uses electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude of a signal applied to its input terminals, producing a proportionally greater amplitude signal at its output. The amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by its gain: the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input. An amplifier is a circuit that has a power gain greater than one.[9][10][11]

amplitude
The height of a wave as measured from its center (normal) position.

angle of incidence
In geometric optics, the angle between a ray incident on a surface and the line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence, called the normal. The ray can be formed by any wave: optical, acoustic, microwave, X-ray, etc.

angle of reflection
The change in direction of a wavefront at an interface between two different media so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated. Common examples include the reflection of light, sound, and water waves. The law of reflection says that for specular reflection the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected. Mirrors exhibit specular reflection.

ångström (Å)
A unit of length primarily used to measure subatomic particles that is equal to 10−10 meters (one ten-billionth of a meter) or 0.1 nanometers.

angular acceleration
The time rate of change of angular velocity. In three dimensions, it is a pseudovector. In SI units, it is measured in radians per second squared (rad/s2), and is usually denoted by the Greek letter alpha (α).[12] Just like angular velocity, there are two types of angular acceleration: spin angular acceleration and orbital angular acceleration, representing the time rate of change of spin angular velocity and orbital angular velocity, respectively. Unlike linear acceleration, angular acceleration need not be caused by a net external torque. For example, a figure skater can speed up her rotation (thereby obtaining an angular acceleration) simply by contracting her arms inwards, which involves no external torque.

angular displacement
The angle (in radians, degrees, or revolutions) through which a point revolving around a centre or line has been rotated in a specified sense about a specified axis.

angular frequency (ω)
Also angular speed, radial frequency, circular frequency, orbital frequency, radian frequency, and pulsatance.
A scalar measure of rotation rate. It refers to the angular displacement per unit time (e.g. in rotation) or the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform (e.g. in oscillations and waves), or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function. Angular frequency (or angular speed) is the magnitude of the vector quantity that is angular velocity. The term angular frequency vector 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              ω

    {\displaystyle {\vec {\omega }}}
  
 is sometimes used as a synonym for the vector quantity angular velocity.[13]

One revolution is equal to 2π radians, hence[13][14]


  
    
      
        ω

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega ={{2\pi } \over T}={2\pi f},}
  

where:
ω is the angular frequency or angular speed (measured in radians per second),
T is the period (measured in seconds),
f is the ordinary frequency (measured in hertz) (sometimes symbolised with ν).

angular momentum
Also (rarely) moment of momentum or rotational momentum.
The rotational equivalent of linear momentum. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity–that is, the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant.

angular velocity (ω)
How fast an object rotates or revolves relative to another point, i.e. how fast the angular position or orientation of an object changes with time. There are two types of angular velocity: orbital angular velocity and spin angular velocity. Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with respect to its centre of rotation. Orbital angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body's centre of rotation revolves about a fixed origin, i.e. the time rate of change of its angular position relative to the origin. In general, angular velocity is measured in angle per unit time, e.g. radians per second. The  SI unit of angular velocity is expressed as radians/sec with the radian having a dimensionless value of unity, thus the SI units of angular velocity are listed as 1/sec. Angular velocity is usually represented by the Greek letter omega (ω, sometimes Ω). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.

anion
A negatively charged ion. Contrast cation.

annihilation
In particle physics, the process that occurs when a subatomic particle collides with its respective antiparticle to produce other particles, such as an electron colliding with a positron to produce two photons.[15] The total energy and momentum of the initial pair are conserved in the process and distributed among a set of other particles in the final state. Antiparticles have exactly opposite additive quantum numbers from particles, so the sums of all quantum numbers of such an original pair are zero. Hence, any set of particles may be produced whose total quantum numbers are also zero as long as conservation of energy and conservation of momentum are obeyed.[16]

anode
The electrode through which a conventional electric current flows into a polarized electrical device; the direction of current flow is, by convention, opposite to the direction of electron flow, and so electrons flow out of the anode. In a galvanic cell, the anode is the negative terminal or pole which emits electrons toward the external part of an electrical circuit. However, in an electrolytic cell, the anode is the wire or plate having excess positive charge, so named because negatively charged anions tend to move towards it. Contrast cathode.

anti-gravity
A theory of creating a place or object that is free from the force of gravity. It does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in free fall or orbit, or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force, such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift.

antimatter


antineutron
The antiparticle of the neutron, with symbol n. It differs from the neutron only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign. It has the same mass as the neutron, and no net electric charge, but has opposite baryon number (+1 for neutron, −1 for the antineutron). This is because the antineutron is composed of antiquarks, while neutrons are composed of quarks. The antineutron consists of one up antiquark and two down antiquarks.

antiparticle
In particle physics, every type of particle has an associated antiparticle with the same mass but with opposite physical charges such as electric charge. For example, the antiparticle of the electron is the antielectron (which is often referred to as the positron). While the electron has a negative electric charge, the positron has a positive electric charge, and is produced naturally in certain types of radioactive decay. Some particles, such as the photon, are their own antiparticle. Otherwise, for each pair of antiparticle partners, one is designated as "normal" matter (the kind comprising all matter with which humans usually interact), and the other (usually given the prefix "anti-") as antimatter.

antiproton


antiquark
For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle known as an antiquark that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties (such as the electric charge) have equal magnitude but opposite sign.

arc length


Archimedes' principle
A physical principle which states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces and acts in the upward direction at the center of mass of the displaced fluid.[17]

area moment of inertia


astrophysics
The branch of astronomy that deals with the physics of the Universe, especially with the compositional nature of celestial bodies rather than their positions or motions in space.

for an arbitrary complex number α, the order of the Bessel function. Although α and −α produce the same differential equation, it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two values in such a way that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of α. The most important cases are when α is an integer or half-integer. Bessel functions for integer α are also known as cylinder functions or the cylindrical harmonics because they appear in the solution to Laplace's equation in cylindrical coordinates. Spherical Bessel functions with half-integer α are obtained when the Helmholtz equation is solved in spherical coordinates.

A hypothetical idealized physical body that completely absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. Perfect black bodies are imagined as substitutes for actual physical bodies in many theoretical discussions of thermodynamics, and the construction of nearly perfect black bodies in the real world remains a topic of interest for materials engineers. Contrast white body.

black-body radiation
The type of electromagnetic radiation within or surrounding a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, or emitted by a black body (an opaque and non-reflective body) held at constant, uniform temperature. The radiation has a specific spectrum and intensity that depends only on the temperature of the body.

The temperature at which a liquid undergoes a phase change into a gas; the vapour pressure of liquid and gas are equal at this temperature.

boiling point elevation
The phenomenon by which the boiling point of a liquid (a solvent) increases when another compound is added, meaning that the resulting solution has a higher boiling point than the pure solvent. This happens whenever a non-volatile solute, such as a salt, is added to a pure solvent, such as water. The boiling point can be measured accurately using an ebullioscope.

calculus
A branch of mathematics that studies change and has two major sub-fields: differential calculus (concerning rates of change and slopes of curves), and integral calculus (concerning accumulation of quantities and the areas under and between curves). These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus.

capacitance
The ratio of the change in the electric charge of a system to the corresponding change in its electric potential. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: self capacitance and mutual capacitance. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance. A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a given voltage than one with low capacitance. The notion of mutual capacitance is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor, one of the three elementary linear electronic components (along with resistors and inductors).

Carnot cycle
A theoretical ideal thermodynamic cycle proposed by French physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824 and expanded upon by others in the 1830s and 1840s. It provides an upper limit on the efficiency that any classical thermodynamic engine can achieve during the conversion of heat into work, or conversely, the efficiency of a refrigeration system in creating a temperature difference by the application of work to the system. It is not an actual thermodynamic cycle but is a theoretical construct.

Cartesian coordinate system
A coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a set of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, measured in the same unit of length. Each reference line is called a coordinate axis or just axis (plural axes) of the system, and the point where they meet is called the origin, at ordered pair (0, 0). The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.

cathode
The electrode through which a conventional electric current flows out of a polarized electrical device; the direction of current flow is, by convention, opposite to the direction of electron flow, and so electrons flow into the cathode. In a galvanic cell, the cathode is the positive terminal or pole which accepts electrons flowing from the external part of an electrical circuit. However, in an electrolytic cell, the cathode is the wire or plate having excess negative charge, so named because positively charged cations tend to move towards it. Contrast anode.

) – as the edges of a three-dimensional cube, at each corner of which is positioned a major sub-field within theoretical physics according to which of the three constants are accounted for by that sub-field and which are ignored. One corner of this so-called "cube of theoretical physics", where all three constants are accounted for simultaneously, has not yet been satisfactorily described: quantum gravity.
