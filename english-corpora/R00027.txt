== Club career ==


=== Celtic ===
Fox began his career at Celtic. However, he never made an appearance for the club. During his time at Celtic, he was part of the side that won the double of under-19 league and the Scottish Youth Cup in 2005 and 2006.

On 15 January 2008, he agreed to move to Ayr United on loan for the rest of the season. However, Celtic cancelled the loan and the transfer never took place.With his contract at Celtic having expired in Summer 2009, Fox went on trial at Exeter City and Lincoln City. However, due to Celtic being entitled to a development fee and still holding his registration as he was under 23, there was no contract offer. Fox eventually took his case to FIFA although he ultimately lost and spent six months without playing.

Manager Gordon Chisholm signed Fox on 29 January 2010, for Dumfries club Queen of the South from Celtic on amateur forms.
