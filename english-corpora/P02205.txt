Being thus accosted by Hanumān, Rāma, the son of Dasaratha, placing that jewel on his breast, wept with Laksmana. Beholding that excellent jewel, Rāghava, stricken with grief, with eyes full of tears, spake to Sugriva, saying. Forsooth my heart melt on beholding this jewel as milk trickle down from the udders of a cow on beholding its calf. This jewel was conferred on Sītā by my father-in-law at the time of our wedding, and to enhance its beauty, she wore it on her head. And this jewel, obtained from the bed of the ocean, was conferred on him (Janaka) by the intelligent Sakra, greatly delighted for being adored in a sacrifice. O gentle one, this bring back to my mind, the memory of my father, and father-in-law the king of Videha. This excellent jewel appeared beautiful on the crown of my dear one, and methinks, on beholding it, I have as if got back my beloved spouse. Do you relate to me again and again, O gentle one what Vaidehi has said, as if sprinkling me with the water of her words like to one rendered senseless. What greater grief can there be, O Saumitri, that I behold the jewel obtained from the ocean but not Vaidehi.? Truly dose Vaidehī live for a long time if she breathes for a month. But O hero, I cannot live blue eyes. Do you take me there where you had beheld iny dear spouse. I cannot live for a moment while I have received intelligence about her. How live that timid damsel, having a beautiful waist, being terrified, amidst the terrible and grim Raksasis? Truly her countenance is not appearing beautiful like to the autumnal moon, enveloped with clouds, although cleared off the darkness. Do you relate to me in sooth, O Hanuman, what Şītā has spoken to you. I shall live by these words, as the sick are cured by medicine. O Hanumān, what has my dear wife, sweetspeeched, and highly beautiful, spoken to you, being separated form me? How breathes she going through a series of calamities?
