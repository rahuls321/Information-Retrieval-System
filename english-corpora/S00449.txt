The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau is a documentary television series about underwater marine life, directed by Alan Landsburg and hosted by French filmmaker, researcher, and marine explorer Jacques Cousteau. The first episodes of the series aired from 1968 until 1976. The English-language narration was by Richard Johnson (BBC version) and Rod Serling (ABC edition). It also featured his sons Jean‑Michel and Philippe, and his grandson Fabien. Jacques' wife, Simone Melchior, worked on board ship, and dived too, but she did not appear on-screen.[1]

Captain Cousteau introduces his first made-for-TV documentary, commissioned by ABC in 1966. The programme charts the ground-breaking Conshelf III project, an experimental underwater habitat based over 100m deep in the Mediterranean Sea. Six divers lived in the specially constructed base for three weeks, paving the way for the future development of saturation diving. The programme was so successful that a series was commissioned: the epic, decade-spanning odyssey of 'The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau'.

9"The Night of the Squid"16 January 1970 (1970-01-16)
The crew observes as 20 million squids amass in coastal waters to mate, spawn and die. In the waters off southern California the Calypso happens upon the savage, yet touching, spawning ritual of the sea arrow squids of the Pacific.
