Gokak (Kannada: ಗೋಕಾಕ) was basically an 'Agrahar' founded in pre-historic period, place of tribal people/jungle people then ruled by Rattas (850 Ad-1250Ad), Bijapur Sultans, Tippu-Sultan and British (1819) and became Municipality in 1853, next to Belgaum City.

Dispute regarding district status[edit]
See also: Belgaum Border dispute
Bifurcation of Belgaum district, which includes a total of 16 talukas, has been a longstanding issue. Being the second largest city in Belgaum district, Gokak has been a strong contender for a separate administrative district. Most of these protests in Gokak have been peaceful, however sometimes these protests have turned out to be violent leading to the damage of public property. The protests are held in neighbouring towns surrounding Gokak also.[11][12]
In October 2008, Bandh was declared in Gokak to demand the District status. All the educational institutions, business establishments, Movie theatres and other trading centres remained closed. The North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) had suspended its transportation services throughout the day but resumed them in the evening.[13]
The P. C Gaddigoudar committee, set up by the state government, recommended formation of Gokak district which would include the talukas of Gokak, Hukkeri, Raybag, Chikkodi and Athani with its sub-divisions at Gokak and Chikkodi, respectively. As of early 2012 no decision has been made regarding bifurcation.[14][15][16][17]

Gokak toys[edit]
Gokak was once famous for its wooden and paper toys. Artificial fruits, vegetables, animals, birds and more are made up of wood and are popularly known as Gokak toys. These toys are predominantly used as display items at homes and are rarely used by the children as toys. Varieties of wood, including hariwala, polki and hale are used to carve out the toys. These toys are found in 144 variants.[59][60]  
The craft of toy making in Gokak is more than 200 years old and is being practiced  by the community of jingars since the last decade of the eighteenth century. The word Jingar is derived from the Persian 'Jin' a saddle, and the traditional occupation of the caste was saddle making. Toy making in Gokak has been a hereditary occupation in nature since decades but since 1956 onwards it is also being carried out by other persons who are trained in the  craft and the tradition.[59]
The Bombay Gazetteer of 1884 refers to Jingars as follows:- They are said to have been brought into Belgaum about a century and a half ago by one Bhimrav son of Anandappa the headman of Kagal in Kolhapur. Bhimrav's grand-son Bapu Jingar, a skilful painter and wooden toy maker was patronised by a chief of Kolhapur about eighty years ago. He lived for ten years in the service of the prince and after his patron died he went to Gokak and lived among his relations, maintaining himself by making wooden toys, palanquins and the Abdgirs or ornamental umbrellas which are carried over native chiefs. It was he who taught his relations how to make wooden toys [59][60]
The Karnataka Government is mulling of applying for Geographical indication tag for Gokak toys.[61]

Books[edit]
