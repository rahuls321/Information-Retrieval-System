In mathematics, a block matrix or a partitioned matrix is a matrix that is interpreted as having been broken into sections called blocks or submatrices. Intuitively, a matrix interpreted as a block matrix can be visualized as the original matrix with a collection of horizontal and vertical lines, which break it up, or partition it, into a collection of smaller matrices. Any matrix may be interpreted as a block matrix in one or more ways, with each interpretation defined by how its rows and columns are partitioned.This notion can be made more precise for an                     n              {\displaystyle n}   by                     m              {\displaystyle m}   matrix                     M              {\displaystyle M}   by partitioning                     n              {\displaystyle n}   into a collection                               rowgroups                      {\displaystyle {\text{rowgroups}}}  , and then partitioning                     m              {\displaystyle m}   into a collection                               colgroups                      {\displaystyle {\text{colgroups}}}  . The original matrix is then considered as the "total" of these groups, in the sense that the                     (        i        ,        j        )              {\displaystyle (i,j)}   entry of the original matrix corresponds in a 1-to-1 way with some                     (        s        ,        t        )              {\displaystyle (s,t)}   offset entry of some                     (        x        ,        y        )              {\displaystyle (x,y)}  , where                     x        ∈                  rowgroups                      {\displaystyle x\in {\text{rowgroups}}}   and                     y        ∈                  colgroups                      {\displaystyle y\in {\text{colgroups}}}  .Block matrix algebra arises in general from biproducts in categories of matrices.

The partitioning of the factors is not arbitrary, however, and requires "conformable partitions" between two matrices                     A              {\displaystyle A}   and                     B              {\displaystyle B}   such that all submatrix products that will be used are defined.

transpose A special form of matrix transpose can also be defined for block matrices, where individual blocks are reordered but not transposed. Let                     A        =        (                  B                      i            j                          )              {\displaystyle A=(B_{ij})}   be a                     k        ×        l              {\displaystyle k\times l}   block matrix with                     m        ×        n              {\displaystyle m\times n}   blocks                               B                      i            j                                {\displaystyle B_{ij}}  , the block transpose of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is the                     l        ×        k              {\displaystyle l\times k}   block matrix                               A                                    B                                            {\displaystyle A^{\mathcal {B}}}   with                     m        ×        n              {\displaystyle m\times n}   blocks                                           (                          A                                                B                                                      )                                i            j                          =                  B                      j            i                                {\displaystyle \left(A^{\mathcal {B}}\right)_{ij}=B_{ji}}  .As with the conventional trace operator, the block transpose is a linear mapping such that                     (        A        +        C                  )                                    B                                      =                  A                                    B                                      +                  C                                    B                                            {\displaystyle (A+C)^{\mathcal {B}}=A^{\mathcal {B}}+C^{\mathcal {B}}}  . However, in general the property                     (        A        C                  )                                    B                                      =                  C                                    B                                                A                                    B                                            {\displaystyle (AC)^{\mathcal {B}}=C^{\mathcal {B}}A^{\mathcal {B}}}   does not hold unless the blocks of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   and                     C              {\displaystyle C}   commute. Direct sum For any arbitrary matrices A (of size m × n) and B (of size p × q), we have the direct sum of A and B, denoted by A                     ⊕              {\displaystyle \oplus }   B and

to arbitrary dimensioned arrays (provided that A and B have the same number of dimensions).Note that any element in the direct sum of two vector spaces of matrices could be represented as a direct sum of two matrices. Application In linear algebra terms, the use of a block matrix corresponds to having a linear mapping thought of in terms of corresponding 'bunches' of basis vectors. That again matches the idea of having distinguished direct sum decompositions of the domain and range. It is always particularly significant if a block is the zero matrix; that carries the information that a summand maps into a sub-sum.Given the interpretation via linear mappings and direct sums, there is a special type of block matrix that occurs for square matrices (the case m = n). For those we can assume an interpretation as an endomorphism of an n-dimensional space V; the block structure in which the bunching of rows and columns is the same is of importance because it corresponds to having a single direct sum decomposition on V (rather than two). In that case, for example, the diagonal blocks in the obvious sense are all square. This type of structure is required to describe the Jordan normal form.This technique is used to cut down calculations of matrices, column-row expansions, and many computer science applications, including VLSI chip design. An example is the Strassen algorithm for fast matrix multiplication, as well as the Hamming(7,4) encoding for error detection and recovery in data transmissions.
