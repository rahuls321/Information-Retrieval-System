A national academy is an organizational body, usually operating with state financial support and approval, that co-ordinates scholarly research activities and standards for academic disciplines, most frequently in the sciences but also the humanities. Typically the country's learned societies in individual disciplines will liaise with or be co-ordinated by the national academy.  National academies play an important organisational role in academic exchanges and collaborations between countries.
The extent of official recognition of national academies varies between countries.  In some cases they are explicitly or de facto an arm of government; in others, as in the United Kingdom, they are voluntary, non-profit bodies with which government has agreed to negotiate, and which may receive government financial support while retaining substantial independence. In some countries, a single academy covers all disciplines; an example is France. In others, there are several academies, which work together more or less closely; for example, Australia. In many states they are organized in Academies of Science. In the countries of the former Soviet Union, and in the People's Republic of China, the national academies have considerable power over policy and personnel in their areas. There is however a growing consensus among international federations of learned academies that bona fide national (or learned) academies need to adhere to certain criteria:

The fellowship is elected, on the basis of excellence, by existing fellows (members)
The number of fellows is restricted either to a total number or to a rate of accretion
The governance of the academy is democratic and “bottom up”. The fellowship is the ultimate source of the academy's authority
The academy is independent of government, industry and professional associations.  Most, if not all, academies derive some financial support from some or all of these other organisations but this support needs to be given in a manner that does not compromise the academy's independence.

United States[edit]
In 1863, President of the United States Abraham Lincoln incorporated the United States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM). The affiliated organisations were granted congressional charters to operate under the National Academy of Sciences. Today NASEM is composed of three non-profit member organisations: the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and the Institute of Medicine (IoM). In 1916 President Woodrow Wilson reincorporated the organisation under the National Research Council to foster scientific research emphasising American industries. The most recent change to NASEM came in 2015 when the IoM was reconstituted as the National Academy of Medicine (NAM).
