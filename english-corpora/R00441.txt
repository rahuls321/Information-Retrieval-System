The riding of Saanich—Gulf Islands consists of the north part of the Municipality of Saanich, as well as the municipalities of Central Saanich, North Saanich, and Sidney on Vancouver Island.

== History ==
The electoral district was created in 1987 from Esquimalt—Saanich and Cowichan—Malahat—The Islands ridings.
The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of Saanich—Gulf Islands should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name will be contested in future elections. The redefined Saanich—Gulf Islands loses a small portion of its current territory in the urbanized portion of Saanich to the new district of Esquimalt—Saanich—Sooke. These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, which was held 19 October 2015.


== Political geography ==
Despite the usually close vote between the various right-leaning parties, the Canadian Alliance, Reform and Conservative parties have consistently won here from 1993-2011. Since 1953, the riding and its predecessor, Esquimalt—Saanich, have only gone to a non-conservative candidate five times: 1968 to Liberal David Anderson, in 1988 to New Democrat Lynn Hunter, and in 2011, 2015 and 2019 to Green party leader Elizabeth May, who in 2015 won every poll-district within the constituency. The 1988 Conservative loss is attributed to vote splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and the new Reform party. Despite a Conservative majority in 2011, the Greens won their very first elected seat here, and has since become their only stronghold in the country. The penisular portion of the riding is more competitive, with significant support for all parties except the Liberals. However, the Gulf Isalnds have probably the strongest Green support in the country, with many voters being environmentally conscious, moderate retirees, as well as a notable artist population. This, combined with a very popular MP in Former leader Elizabeth May, Saanich Gulf Islands becoming the safest Green riding. Even with the Green collapse nationally in 2021, May held on with 37%, although it was her lowest voteshare in the riding.
