Like to servants waiting upon a wealthy person various auspicious omens waited upon Sītā of a blameless and comely person, racked with grief and divested of joy. And the large left eye of that dame having graceful hairs, having dark pupils, white ends and thick eye-lashes, began to dance like a lotus shaken by a fish. And her beautiful, round, plump left hand, which, ere this, sprinkled with costly aguru and sandal, used to serve for a pillow to Rāma, began to dance now again and again after a long time. And her well built plump left thigh, resembling the trunk of an elephant, dancing, announced that she would soon behold Rāma. And the gold-hued cloth, now covered with dust, of that damsel of a comely person, having teeth like pomegranate seeds, slipped a little off its place. And being enlivened by those and various other auspicious omens, she attained joy like to a seed, spoiled by the wind and the sun, growing afresh in the rainy season. And her countenance, having lips red as Bimba fruits, beautiful eyes, eye-brows extending to ears, curling eye-lashes and white teeth, again appeared graceful like to the Moon released from the full grasp of Rahu. (Like the Moon when full eclipse is just over-In mythology Rāhu is the son of Sinika, a Daitya, with the tail of a dragon whose head was severed from-his body by Vişnu, but being immortal this head and tail retained their separate existence and being transferred to the stellar sphere, became the authors of eclipses.) Her grief and exhaustion were removed. sorrow was pacified and her heart was filled with joy. And she with her countenance appeared beautiful like a lunar night beautified by the rays of the Moon.
