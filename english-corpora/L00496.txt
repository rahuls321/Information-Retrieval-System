TV Tropes is a wiki website that collects and documents descriptions and examples of plot conventions and devices, more commonly known as tropes, within many creative works.[6] Since its establishment in 2004, the site has shifted focus from covering only television and film tropes to those in general media such as literature, comics, anime, manga, video games, radio, music, advertising, and toys, and their associated fandoms, as well as some non-media subjects such as history, geography, politics, and other real life occurrences, people, and events.[7][8] The nature of the site as a provider of commentary on pop culture and fiction has attracted attention and criticism from several web personalities and blogs.
From April 2008 until July 2012, TV Tropes published free content.[9] In July 2012, TV Tropes modified its license to allow only non-commercial distribution of its content but continued to host the prior submissions under a new distribution license.[10][11]
The TV Tropes website runs on its own wiki engine software, a heavily modified version of PmWiki, but is not open source.[5] Before October 2010, it was possible to edit anonymously. Registration is now mandatory for all other activities besides viewing the website.[12]

Site description[edit]
Ownership[edit]
TV Tropes was founded in 2004 by a programmer under the pseudonym "Fast Eddie." He described himself as having become interested in the conventions of genre fiction while studying at MIT in the 1970s and after browsing Internet forums in the 1990s.[13] He sold the site in 2014 to Drew Schoentrup and Chris Richmond, who then launched a Kickstarter to overhaul the codebase and design.[14]

Content[edit]
Initially focused on the TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer, TV Tropes has since covered television series, films, novels, plays, professional wrestling, video games, anime, manga, comic strips/books, and fan fiction.[13] It renders many other subjects, including Internet works such as Wikipedia (often referred to in a tongue-in-cheek way as "The Other Wiki").[14] Additionally, articles on the site often relate to real life or point out real situations where certain tropes can or cannot be applied. It has also used its informal style to describe topics such as science, philosophy, politics, and history under its Useful Notes section. TV Tropes does not have notability standards for the works it covers.[13] It also can be used for recommending lesser-known media on the "Needs More Love" page.

Reception[edit]
In an interview with TV Tropes co-founder Fast Eddie, Gawker Media's blog io9 described the tone of contributions to the site as "often light and funny". Cyberpunk author Bruce Sterling once described its style as a "wry fanfic analysis".[15] Essayist Linda Börzsei described TV Tropes as a technological continuum of classical archetypal literary criticisms, capable of deconstructing recurring elements from creative works in an ironic fashion.[16] Economist Robin Hanson, inspired by a scholarly analysis of Victorian literature,[17] suggests TV Tropes offers a veritable treasure trove of information about fiction – a prime opportunity for research into its nature.[18] In Lifehacker, Nick Douglas compared TV Tropes to Wikipedia, recommending to "use [TV Tropes] when Wikipedia feels impenetrable, when you want opinions more than facts, or when you've finished a Wikipedia page and now you want the juicy parts, the hard-to-confirm bits that Wikipedia doesn't share."[19]
David Savat and Tauel HarperIt say TV Tropes offers a 'wonderful archeology of storytelling' but criticize the site for undermining creativity and experience by attempting to 'classify and represent' every part of a work.[20]

Controversies[edit]
Mature content incident[edit]
In October 2010, in what the site refers to as "The Google Incident", Google temporarily withdrew its AdSense service from the site after determining that pages regarding adult and mature tropes were inconsistent with its terms of service.  The site separated NSFG articles (Not Safe for Google) from SFG articles (Safe for Google) in order to allow discussion of these kinds of tropes.[12][21]
In a separate incident in 2012, in response to other complaints by Google, TV Tropes changed its guidelines to restrict coverage of sexist tropes and rape tropes. Feminist blog The Mary Sue criticized this decision, as it censored documentation of sexist tropes in video games and young adult fiction.[22] ThinkProgress additionally condemned Google AdSense itself for "providing a financial disincentive to discuss" such topics.[23] Pornographic tropes and works, as well as additional content deemed inappropriate for coverage on site, were also made prohibited following the incident.

Licensing and content forks[edit]
TV Tropes content was licensed since April 2008 with the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike (CC BY-SA)[9][24] license for free content. In July 2012, the site changed its license notice and its existing content to the incompatible Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike version (CC BY-NC-SA).[25][26] In November 2013, TV Tropes added a clause to their Terms of Use requiring all contributors to grant the site irrevocable, exclusive ownership of their contributions.[4][27][28] In March 2015, this clause was removed, replaced with an assertion that TV Tropes does not claim ownership of user generated content.[29] The site license also states that it is not required to attribute user content to its authors,[30] although the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license requires attribution of the original author.
Regarding these and other concerns of re-licensing and advertising, a wiki called "All The Tropes" forked all the content from TV Tropes with the original CC BY-SA license in late 2013. Authors of the fork attributed several actions of taking commercial rights over what is published on its website, censorship, and failing to comply with the original license to TV Tropes managers.[31] Some editors raised concerns that keeping the content submitted with the previous copyleft license at TV Tropes is illegal, as the re-licensing had occurred without the permission of the editors and the original CC BY-SA license did not allow its distribution under the new terms.[11]
