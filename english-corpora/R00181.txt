Ippolito Costa (1506 â€“ 8 November 1561) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance period. He was born in Mantua, the son of the painter Lorenzo Costa. Although not a pupil of Giulio Romano, his style closely imitated that master. He mentored his brother Girolamo Costa (1525-1595) and the painter Bernardino Campi.
