This is a list of Ig Nobel Prize winners from 1991 to the present day.[1]
A parody of the Nobel Prizes, the Ig Nobel Prizes are awarded each year in mid-September, around the time the recipients of the genuine Nobel Prizes are announced, for ten achievements that "first make people laugh, and then make them think". Commenting on the 2006 awards, Marc Abrahams, editor of Annals of Improbable Research and co-sponsor of the awards, said that "[t]he prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honor the imaginative, and spur people's interest in science, medicine, and technology".[2] All prizes are awarded for real achievements, except for three in 1991 and one in 1994, due to an erroneous press release.

2004[edit]

Biology – Presented to Ben Wilson of the University of British Columbia, Lawrence Dill of Simon Fraser University, Canada, Robert Batty of the Scottish Association for Marine Science, Magnus Wahlberg of the University of Aarhus, Denmark, and Håkan Westerberg of Sweden's National Board of Fisheries, for showing that herrings apparently communicate by farting.[88][89]
It has been suggested that the study of this phenomenon has had major political consequences. Following the sensational stranding of a Soviet submarine deep inside Swedish waters on 27 October 1981, the Swedish navy initiated a large-scale campaign to guard Swedish territorial waters from the perceived threat of infiltration by foreign submarines, despite the Soviets consistently asserting that the stranding had occurred due to navigational errors. The "submarine hunts", which lasted throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, have been a heavily debated issue in Sweden, as to whether or not there ever was any factual substance to the claims of Soviet infiltration. One widely reported piece of "evidence" were several sound recordings of what the Swedish navy suspected to be foreign submarines. Oceanographers and marine biologists were invited to study the recordings and would eventually find that the sounds heard were most probably produced not by submarines, but in fact were the noises made when herring passed gas. In a reportage by the Swedish science magazine "Vetenskapens värld" ("World of science") televised on 16 April 2012, it's suggested that these findings were important in putting an end to the costly "submarine hunts" which had continued for more than a decade, with Ig Nobel laurate Håkan Westerberg guessing that this would have saved Swedish tax payers hundreds of millions in SEK.[90]

Interestingly, the facility was partly inspired by previous research conducted by Russian physicist Andrew Geim in which he floated a frog with a magnet. The experiment earned Geim the Ig Nobel Prize in Physics, a satirical award given to unusual scientific research. It’s cool that a quirky experiment involving floating a frog could lead to something approaching an honest-to-God antigravity chamber.

It is said to be the first of its kind and could play a key role in the country’s future lunar missions. Landscape is supported by a magnetic field and was inspired by experiments to levitate a frog.

^ "Sec 2010: Cambia il sistema dei conti nazionali" (in Italian). ISTAT. 28 January 2014. Retrieved 22 July 2015. Negli ultimi due anni, pressoché tutti gli aspetti della compilazione dei conti nazionali italiani sono stati sottoposti a verifica e a modifiche finalizzate a migliorarne sia i presupposti metodologici, sia le fonti dei dati. Ne deriva un aumento della robustezza delle misurazioni ma anche l'emergere di revisioni significative per molti aggregati economici (lo stesso livello del Pil, il valore aggiunto settoriale, l'occupazione, ecc.).  Molte di queste innovazioni sono fondate sull'utilizzo di nuove fonti informative, provenienti dall'integrazione tra basi di dati amministrativi e dati di indagine (ad esempio la nuova base di informazioni per le statistiche strutturali di impresa). La disponibilità di basi informative più ricche, che permettono un utilizzo massiccio di dati individuali relativi a imprese e lavoratori, ha contribuito in maniera determinante al ridisegno delle procedure di stima di due degli elementi centrali dei conti nazionali: il modello di definizione dell'input di lavoro e i metodi di misura dell'economia non-osservata e, in particolare, della componente connessa con la sotto dichiarazione dell'attività economica da parte della imprese
