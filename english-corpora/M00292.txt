In linear algebra, a tridiagonal matrix is a band matrix that has nonzero elements on the main diagonal, the first diagonal below this, and the first diagonal above the main diagonal only.For example, the following matrix is tridiagonal:                                          (                                                            1                                                  4                                                  0                                                  0                                                                              3                                                  4                                                  1                                                  0                                                                              0                                                  2                                                  3                                                  4                                                                              0                                                  0                                                  1                                                  3                                                      )                          .              {\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}1&4&0&0\\3&4&1&0\\0&2&3&4\\0&0&1&3\\\end{pmatrix}}.}  The determinant of a tridiagonal matrix is given by the continuant of its elements.An orthogonal transformation of a symmetric (or Hermitian) matrix to tridiagonal form can be done with the Lanczos algorithm. Properties A tridiagonal matrix is a matrix that is both upper and lower Hessenberg matrix. In particular, a tridiagonal matrix is a direct sum of p 1-by-1 and q 2-by-2 matrices such that p + q/2 = n — the dimension of the tridiagonal. Although a general tridiagonal matrix is not necessarily symmetric or Hermitian, many of those that arise when solving linear algebra problems have one of these properties. Furthermore, if a real tridiagonal matrix A satisfies ak,k+1 ak+1,k > 0 for all k, so that the signs of its entries are symmetric, then it is similar to a Hermitian matrix, by a diagonal change of basis matrix. Hence, its eigenvalues are real. If we replace the strict inequality by ak,k+1 ak+1,k ≥ 0, then by continuity, the eigenvalues are still guaranteed to be real, but the matrix need no longer be similar to a Hermitian matrix.The set of all n × n tridiagonal matrices forms a 3n-2dimensional vector space.Many linear algebra algorithms require significantly less computational effort when applied to diagonal matrices, and this improvement often carries over to tridiagonal matrices as well.= Determinant =The determinant of a tridiagonal matrix A of order n can be computed from a three-term recurrence relation. Write f1 = |a1| = a1 (i.e., f1 is the determinant of the 1 by 1 matrix consisting only of a1), and let                              f                      n                          =                              |                                                                                a                                          1                                                                                                            b                                          1                                                                                                                                        c                                          1                                                                                                            a                                          2                                                                                                            b                                          2                                                                                                                                                        c                                          2                                                                                        ⋱                                                  ⋱                                                                                                              ⋱                                                  ⋱                                                                      b                                          n                      −                      1                                                                                                                                                                                        c                                          n                      −                      1                                                                                                            a                                          n                                                                                            |                          .              {\displaystyle f_{n}={\begin{vmatrix}a_{1}&b_{1}\\c_{1}&a_{2}&b_{2}\\&c_{2}&\ddots &\ddots \\&&\ddots &\ddots &b_{n-1}\\&&&c_{n-1}&a_{n}\end{vmatrix}}.}  The sequence (fi) is called the continuant and satisfies the recurrence relation                              f                      n                          =                  a                      n                                    f                      n            −            1                          −                  c                      n            −            1                                    b                      n            −            1                                    f                      n            −            2                                {\displaystyle f_{n}=a_{n}f_{n-1}-c_{n-1}b_{n-1}f_{n-2}}  with initial values f0 = 1 and f−1 = 0.

Computer programming A transformation that reduces a general matrix to Hessenberg form will reduce a Hermitian matrix to tridiagonal form.  So, many eigenvalue algorithms, when applied to a Hermitian matrix, reduce the input Hermitian matrix to (symmetric real) tridiagonal form as a first step.A tridiagonal matrix can also be stored more efficiently than a general matrix by using a special storage scheme. For instance, the LAPACK Fortran package stores an unsymmetric tridiagonal matrix of order n in three one-dimensional arrays, one of length n containing the diagonal elements, and two of length n − 1 containing the subdiagonal and superdiagonal elements.
