In number theory, a Heegner number (as termed by Conway and Guy) is a square-free positive integer d such that the imaginary quadratic field                               Q                          [                                    −              d                                ]                      {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} \left[{\sqrt {-d}}\right]}   has class number 1. Equivalently, its ring of integers has unique factorization.The determination of such numbers is a special case of the class number problem, and they underlie several striking results in number theory.According to the (Baker–)Stark–Heegner theorem there are precisely nine Heegner numbers:This result was conjectured by Gauss and proved up to minor flaws by Kurt Heegner in 1952.  Alan Baker and Harold Stark independently proved the result in 1966, and Stark further indicated the gap in Heegner's proof was minor. Euler's prime-generating polynomial Euler's prime-generating polynomialwhich gives (distinct) primes for n = 0, ..., 39, is related to the Heegner number 163 = 4 · 41 − 1.Rabinowitz proved thatgives primes for                     n        =        0        ,        …        ,        p        −        2              {\displaystyle n=0,\dots ,p-2}   if and only if this quadratic's discriminant                     1        −        4        p              {\displaystyle 1-4p}   is the negative of a Heegner number.(Note that                     p        −        1              {\displaystyle p-1}   yields                               p                      2                                {\displaystyle p^{2}}  , so                     p        −        2              {\displaystyle p-2}   is maximal.)1, 2, and 3 are not of the required form, so the Heegner numbers that work are 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163, yielding prime generating functions of Euler's form for 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 41; these latter numbers are called lucky numbers of Euler by F. Le Lionnais. Almost integers and Ramanujan's constant Ramanujan's constant is the transcendental number                              e                      π                                          163                                                          {\displaystyle e^{\pi {\sqrt {163}}}}  , which is an almost integer, in that it is very close to an integer:This number was discovered in 1859 by the mathematician Charles Hermite.In a 1975 April Fool article in Scientific American magazine, "Mathematical Games" columnist Martin Gardner made the hoax claim that the number was in fact an integer, and that the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan had predicted it—hence its name.This coincidence is explained by complex multiplication and the q-expansion of the j-invariant.= Detail =Briefly,                               j                      (                                                            1                  +                                                            −                      d                                                                      2                                      )                                {\displaystyle \textstyle j\left({\frac {1+{\sqrt {-d}}}{2}}\right)}   is an integer for d a Heegner number, andvia the q-expansion.If                     τ              {\displaystyle \tau }   is a quadratic irrational, then the j-invariant is an algebraic integer of degree                               |                                    C              l                                                      (                                                    Q                        (            τ            )                                          )                                              |                      {\displaystyle \left|\mathrm {Cl} {\bigl (}\mathbf {Q} (\tau ){\bigr )}\right|}  , the class number of                               Q                (        τ        )              {\displaystyle \mathbf {Q} (\tau )}   and the minimal (monic integral) polynomial it satisfies is called the 'Hilbert class polynomial'. Thus if the imaginary quadratic extension                               Q                (        τ        )              {\displaystyle \mathbf {Q} (\tau )}   has class number 1 (so d is a Heegner number), the j-invariant is an integer.The q-expansion of j, with its Fourier series expansion written as a Laurent series in terms of                     q        =                  e                      2            π            i            τ                                {\displaystyle q=e^{2\pi i\tau }}  , begins as:The coefficients                               c                      n                                {\displaystyle c_{n}}   asymptotically grow asand the low order coefficients grow more slowly than                     200                          000                      n                                {\displaystyle 200\,000^{n}}  , so for                               q          ≪                                    1                              200                                000                                                          {\displaystyle \textstyle q\ll {\frac {1}{200\,000}}}  , j is very well approximated by its first two terms.

Pi formulas The Chudnovsky brothers found in 1987 thata proof of which uses the fact thatFor similar formulas, see the Ramanujan–Sato series. Other Heegner numbers For the four largest Heegner numbers, the approximations one obtains are as follows.Alternatively,where the reason for the squares is due to certain Eisenstein series.  For Heegner numbers                     d        <        19              {\displaystyle d<19}  , one does not obtain an almost integer; even                     d        =        19              {\displaystyle d=19}   is not noteworthy.  The integer j-invariants are highly factorisable, which follows from the form                              12                      3                                                (                                          n                                  2                                            −              1                        )                                3                          =                              (                                          2                                  2                                            ⋅              3              ⋅              (              n              −              1              )              ⋅              (              n              +              1              )                        )                                3                          ,              {\displaystyle 12^{3}\left(n^{2}-1\right)^{3}=\left(2^{2}\cdot 3\cdot (n-1)\cdot (n+1)\right)^{3},}  and factor as,These transcendental numbers, in addition to being closely approximated by integers (which are simply algebraic numbers of degree 1), can be closely approximated by algebraic numbers of degree 3,The roots of the cubics can be exactly given by quotients of the Dedekind eta function η(τ), a modular function involving a 24th root, and which explains the 24 in the approximation. They can also be closely approximated by algebraic numbers of degree 4,If                     x              {\displaystyle x}   denotes the expression within the parenthesis (e.g.                     x        =        3        −                              2                          (                              1                −                                                                            96                      24                                                                      +                1                                                      3                    ⋅                    19                                                              )                                            {\displaystyle x=3-{\sqrt {2\left(1-{\tfrac {96}{24}}+1{\sqrt {3\cdot 19}}\right)}}}  ), it satisfies respectively the quartic equations Note the reappearance of the integers                     n        =        3        ,        9        ,        21        ,        231              {\displaystyle n=3,9,21,231}   as well as the fact thatwhich, with the appropriate fractional power, are precisely the j-invariants.  Similarly for algebraic numbers of degree 6,where the xs are given respectively by the appropriate root of the sextic equations,with the j-invariants appearing again.  These sextics are not only algebraic, they are also solvable in radicals as they factor into two cubics over the extension                               Q                                      5                                {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} {\sqrt {5}}}   (with the first factoring further into two quadratics). These algebraic approximations can be exactly expressed in terms of Dedekind eta quotients. As an example, let                               τ          =                                                    1                +                                                      −                    163                                                              2                                            {\displaystyle \textstyle \tau ={\frac {1+{\sqrt {-163}}}{2}}}  , then,where the eta quotients are the algebraic numbers given above.
