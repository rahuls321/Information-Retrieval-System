Malhun Hatun[edit]
At first, when the series was named Diriliş: Osman, Aslıhan Karalar, the actress who played Burçin Hatun, was thought to play the role of Malhun Hatun,[46][47] who didn't even appear in the first season. The thought was established due to the fact that Malhun Hatun was Osman I's first wife according to history and that Aslıhan Karalar was the first young actress who was confirmed to join the series. However, in the series, Osman's first partner is Bala Hatun and she was played by the Turkish actress Özge Törer,[14] this was only believed after the series' first episode was released. Before the release of season 2, Özge Yağız and Yağmur Öztürk were believed to play the role of Malhun Hatun due to the fact that they both shared videos of them taking fencing lessons. This thought was dropped after Özge Yağız took part in the TV series Sol Yanım [tr] and Yağmur Öztürk took part in the TV series Acemi Anneler [tr]. Yağmur Öztürk was still, however, rumoured to play the role at some point.[48] The 43rd episode trailer then revealed that Funda Güray [tr] was likely to play this role,[49] however, it turned out that she would play the role of "Aksu Hatun". It was later confirmed that Yıldız Çağrı Atiksoy would be playing the role.[50][11]

Ertuğrul Gazi[edit]
Mehmet Bozdağ has said there will be a surprise about this character in Kuruluş: Osman while Engin Altan Düzyatan, who plays Ertuğrul in Diriliş: Ertuğrul, has also said that he may give a surprise in the series but "no clear decision can be made".[51] It is very likely that he may later appear in some dreams (like Süleyman Şah) or appear in a flashback. Ertuğrul was at first thought to appear in season 1, then when he didn't appear, he was still thought to be played by Engin Altan but appear in season 2. Some other rumours indicated that Ediz Hun will play his role.[52][53] The character's appearance was confirmed at this point. Then when the first trailer was released, it was confirmed that Tamer Yiğit would be playing the role of Ertuğrul.[54]
