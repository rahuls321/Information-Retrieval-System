SECTION LIX
Vaisampayana said,--"When the play commenced, all those kings with
Dhritarashtra at their head took their seats in that assembly. And, O
Bharata, Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and the high-souled Vidura with
cheerless hearts sat behind. And those kings with leonine necks and
endued with great energy took their seats separately and in pairs upon
many elevated seats of beautiful make and colour. And, O king, that
mansion looked resplendent with those assembled kings like heaven itself
with a conclave of the celestials of great good fortune. And they were
all conversant with the Vedas and brave and of resplendent countenances.
And, O great king, the friendly match at dice then commenced.
Yudhishthira said,--"O king, this excellent wealth of pearls of great
value, procured from the ocean by churning it (of old), so beautiful and
decked with pure gold, this, O king, is my stake. What is thy counter
stake, O great king,--the wealth with which thou wishest to play with me?"
"Duryodhana said,--'I have many jewels and much wealth. But I am not vain
of them. Win thou this stake.'
Vaisampayana continued,--"Then Sakuni, well-skilled at dice, took up the
dice and (casting them) said unto Yudhishthira, 'Lo, I have won!'"
