Blackbuck National Park at Velavadar is situated near Vallabhipur (Vallabhi) in the Bhavnagar District of Gujarat state.


Understand[edit]
History[edit]
The Blackbuck National Park is around 50 km from the district headquarter city of Bhavnagar in Bhal region. In 1976, Government of India declared approx. 34 km² of grassland as National Park. The movements of blackbucks and nilgais (Blue bull) increase beauty of this park. The blackbuck is most famous for its jumping over the levels of grass. Since it is grassland, beauty of this park can be seen from long distant.

Landscape[edit]
The park is surrounded Gulf of Khambhat on the south and by wastelands and agriculture fields on the other sides. It was grassland of the Maharaja of the princely state of Bhavnagar. The national park has been classified as 4B Gujarat-Rajwada biotic province of semi-arid bio-geographical zone.

Flora and fauna[edit]
The distinctive horns of the Blackbuck are ringed with 1 to 4 spiral turns, rarely more than 4 turns, and can be as long as 28 inches (79 cm). A trophy Blackbuck is over 18 inches. In the male, the upper body is black (dark brown), and the belly and eye rings are white. The light-brown female is usually hornless. Blackbucks usually roam the plains in herds of 15 to 20 animals with one dominant male.
On the open plain, the Blackbuck is one of the fastest animals and can outrun most predators over long distances. Its chief predator was the now extinct Indian Cheetah. It is now sometimes preyed upon by wolves, feral dogs, etc.
The diet of the Blackbuck consists mostly of grasses, although it does eat pods, flowers and fruits to supplement its diet. The maximum life span recorded is 16 years and the average is 12 years. Mating season of the Black Buck rests from August to October and March to April.
