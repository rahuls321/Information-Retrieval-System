In linear algebra, the Cholesky decomposition or Cholesky factorization (pronounced  shə-LES-kee) is a decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose, which is useful for efficient numerical solutions, e.g., Monte Carlo simulations. It was discovered by André-Louis Cholesky for real matrices, and posthumously published in 1924.When it is applicable, the Cholesky decomposition is roughly twice as efficient as the LU decomposition for solving systems of linear equations. Statement The Cholesky decomposition of a Hermitian positive-definite matrix A, is a decomposition of the form                              A                =                              L            L                                ∗                          ,              {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {LL} ^{*},}  where L is a lower triangular matrix with real and positive diagonal entries, and L* denotes the conjugate transpose of L. Every Hermitian positive-definite matrix (and thus also every real-valued symmetric positive-definite matrix) has a unique Cholesky decomposition.The converse holds trivially: if A can be written as LL* for some invertible L, lower triangular or otherwise, then A is Hermitian and positive definite.When A is a real matrix (hence symmetric positive-definite), the factorization may be written                              A                =                              L            L                                              T                                      ,              {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {LL} ^{\mathsf {T}},}  where L is a real lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal entries.= Positive semidefinite matrices =If a Hermitian matrix A is only positive semidefinite, instead of positive definite, then it still has a decomposition of the form A = LL* where the diagonal entries of L are allowed to be zero.The decomposition need not be unique, for example:                                          [                                                            0                                                  0                                                                              0                                                  1                                                      ]                          =                  L                                      L                                ∗                          ,                                  L                =                              [                                                            0                                                  0                                                                              cos                  ⁡                  θ                                                  sin                  ⁡                  θ                                                      ]                          .              {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}}=\mathbf {L} \mathbf {L} ^{*},\quad \quad \mathbf {L} ={\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\\cos \theta &\sin \theta \end{bmatrix}}.}  However, if the rank of A is r, then there is a unique lower triangular L with exactly r positive diagonal elements and n−r columns containing all zeroes.Alternatively, the decomposition can be made unique when a pivoting choice is fixed. Formally, if A is an n × n positive semidefinite matrix of rank r, then there is at least one permutation matrix P such that P A PT has a unique decomposition of the form P A PT = L L* with                              L                =                              [                                                                                                      L                                                              1                                                                                        0                                                                                                                        L                                                              2                                                                                        0                                                      ]                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} ={\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf {L} _{1}&0\\\mathbf {L} _{2}&0\end{bmatrix}}}  ,where L1 is an r × r lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal. LDL decomposition A closely related variant of the classical Cholesky decomposition is the LDL decomposition,                              A                =                              L            D            L                                ∗                          ,              {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {LDL} ^{*},}  where L is a lower unit triangular (unitriangular) matrix, and D is a diagonal matrix.That is, the diagonal elements of L are required to be 1 at the cost of introducing an additional diagonal matrix D in the decomposition.The main advantage is that the LDL decomposition can be computed and used with essentially the same algorithms, but avoids extracting square roots.For this reason, the LDL decomposition is often called the square-root-free Cholesky decomposition. For real matrices, the factorization has the form A = LDLT and is often referred to as LDLT decomposition (or LDLT decomposition, or LDL′).  It is reminiscent of the eigendecomposition of real symmetric matrices, A = QΛQT, but is quite different in practice because A and D are not similar matrices.The LDL decomposition is related to the classical Cholesky decomposition of the form LL* as follows:                              A                =                              L            D            L                                ∗                          =                  L                                      D                                1                          /                        2                                                (                                          D                                            1                                  /                                2                                      )                                ∗                                                L                                ∗                          =                  L                                      D                                1                          /                        2                                                (                                          L                                                              D                                                  1                                      /                                    2                                                      )                                ∗                          .              {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {LDL} ^{*}=\mathbf {L} \mathbf {D} ^{1/2}\left(\mathbf {D} ^{1/2}\right)^{*}\mathbf {L} ^{*}=\mathbf {L} \mathbf {D} ^{1/2}\left(\mathbf {L} \mathbf {D} ^{1/2}\right)^{*}.}  Conversely, given the classical Cholesky decomposition                               A                =                  C                                      C                                ∗                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {C} \mathbf {C} ^{*}}   of a positive definite matrix, if S is a diagonal matrix that contains the main diagonal of                               C                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {C} }  , then a A can be decomposed as                               L                          D                                      L                                ∗                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} \mathbf {D} \mathbf {L} ^{*}}   where                              L                =                  C                                      S                                −            1                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {C} \mathbf {S} ^{-1}}   (this rescales each column to make diagonal elements 1),                              D                =                              S                                2                          .              {\displaystyle \mathbf {D} =\mathbf {S} ^{2}.}  If A is positive definite then the diagonal elements of D are all positive.For positive semidefinite A, an                                L                          D                                      L                                ∗                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} \mathbf {D} \mathbf {L} ^{*}}   decomposition exists where the number of non-zero elements on the diagonal D is exactly the rank of A.Some indefinite matrices for which no Cholesky decomposition exists have an LDL decomposition with negative entries in D: it suffices that the first n−1 leading principal minors of A are non-singular.

  Applications The Cholesky decomposition is mainly used for the numerical solution of linear equations                               A          x                =                  b                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {Ax} =\mathbf {b} }  . If A is symmetric and positive definite, then we can solve                                A          x                =                  b                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {Ax} =\mathbf {b} }   by first computing the Cholesky decomposition                                A                =                              L            L                                              ∗                                            {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {LL} ^{\mathrm {*} }}  , then solving                               L          y                =                  b                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {Ly} =\mathbf {b} }   for y by forward substitution, and finally solving                                           L                          ∗                                x                =                  y                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {L^{*}x} =\mathbf {y} }   for x by back substitution.An alternative way to eliminate taking square roots in the                                           L            L                                              ∗                                            {\displaystyle \mathbf {LL} ^{\mathrm {*} }}   decomposition is to compute the Cholesky decomposition                               A                =                              L            D            L                                              ∗                                            {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {LDL} ^{\mathrm {*} }}  , then solving                               L          y                =                  b                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {Ly} =\mathbf {b} }   for y, and finally solving                                           D            L                                              ∗                                                x                =                  y                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {DL} ^{\mathrm {*} }\mathbf {x} =\mathbf {y} }  .For linear systems that can be put into symmetric form, the Cholesky decomposition (or its LDL variant) is the method of choice, for superior efficiency and numerical stability. Compared to the LU decomposition, it is roughly twice as efficient.= Linear least squares =Systems of the form Ax = b with A symmetric and positive definite arise quite often in applications. For instance, the normal equations in linear least squares problems are of this form. It may also happen that matrix A comes from an energy functional, which must be positive from physical considerations; this happens frequently in the numerical solution of partial differential equations.= Non-linear optimization =Non-linear multi-variate functions may be minimized over their parameters using variants of Newton's method called quasi-Newton methods.  At iteration k, the search steps in a direction                               p                      k                                {\displaystyle p_{k}}   defined by solving                               B                      k                                    p                      k                          =        −                  g                      k                                {\displaystyle B_{k}p_{k}=-g_{k}}   for                               p                      k                                {\displaystyle p_{k}}  , where                               p                      k                                {\displaystyle p_{k}}   is the step direction,                               g                      k                                {\displaystyle g_{k}}   is the gradient, and                               B                      k                                {\displaystyle B_{k}}   is an approximation to the Hessian matrix formed by repeating rank-1 updates at each iteration.  Two well-known update formulas are called Davidon–Fletcher–Powell (DFP) and Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS). Loss of the positive-definite condition through round-off error is avoided if rather than updating an approximation to the inverse of the Hessian, one updates the Cholesky decomposition of an approximation of the Hessian matrix itself.= Monte Carlo simulation =The Cholesky decomposition is commonly used in the Monte Carlo method for simulating systems with multiple correlated variables. The covariance matrix is decomposed to give the lower-triangular L. Applying this to a vector of uncorrelated samples u produces a sample vector Lu with the covariance properties of the system being modeled.The following simplified example shows the economy one gets from the Cholesky decomposition:  suppose the goal is to generate two correlated normal variables                               x                      1                                {\displaystyle x_{1}}   and                               x                      2                                {\displaystyle x_{2}}   with given correlation coefficient                     ρ              {\displaystyle \rho }  . To accomplish that, it is necessary to first generate two uncorrelated Gaussian random variables                               z                      1                                {\displaystyle z_{1}}   and                               z                      2                                {\displaystyle z_{2}}  , which can be done using a Box–Muller transform.  Given the  required correlation coefficient                     ρ              {\displaystyle \rho }  , the correlated normal variables can be obtained via the transformations                               x                      1                          =                  z                      1                                {\displaystyle x_{1}=z_{1}}   and                               x                      2                          =        ρ                  z                      1                          +                              1            −                          ρ                              2                                                              z                      2                                {\textstyle x_{2}=\rho z_{1}+{\sqrt {1-\rho ^{2}}}z_{2}}  .= Kalman filters =Unscented Kalman filters commonly use the Cholesky decomposition to choose a set of so-called sigma points.  The Kalman filter tracks the average state of a system as a vector x of length N and covariance as an N × N matrix P.  The matrix P is always positive semi-definite and can be decomposed into LLT.  The columns of L can be added and subtracted from the mean x to form a set of 2N vectors called sigma points.  These sigma points completely capture the mean and covariance of the system state.= Matrix inversion =The explicit inverse of a Hermitian matrix can be computed by Cholesky decomposition, in a manner similar to solving linear systems, using                               n                      3                                {\displaystyle n^{3}}   operations (                                                        1              2                                                n                      3                                {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}n^{3}}   multiplications). The entire inversion can even be efficiently performed in-place.A non-Hermitian matrix B can also be inverted using the following identity, where BB* will always be Hermitian:                                          B                                −            1                          =                              B                                ∗                          (                              B            B                                ∗                                    )                      −            1                          .              {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} ^{-1}=\mathbf {B} ^{*}(\mathbf {BB} ^{*})^{-1}.}   Computation There are various methods for calculating the Cholesky decomposition. The computational complexity of commonly used algorithms is O(n3) in general. The algorithms described below all involve about (1/3)n3 FLOPs (n3/6 multiplications and the same number of additions) for real flavors and (4/3)n3 FLOPs for complex flavors, where n is the size of the matrix A. Hence, they have half the cost of the LU decomposition, which uses 2n3/3 FLOPs (see Trefethen and Bau 1997).Which of the algorithms below is faster depends on the details of the implementation. Generally, the first algorithm will be slightly slower because it accesses the data in a less regular manner.= The Cholesky algorithm =The Cholesky algorithm, used to calculate the decomposition matrix L, is a modified version of Gaussian elimination.The recursive algorithm starts with i := 1 andA(1) := A.At step i, the matrix A(i) has the following form:

The computation is usually arranged in either of the following orders:The Cholesky–Banachiewicz algorithm starts from the upper left corner of the matrix L and proceeds to calculate the matrix row by row. The Cholesky–Crout algorithm starts from the upper left corner of the matrix L and proceeds to calculate the matrix column by column. Either pattern of access allows the entire computation to be performed in-place if desired.= Stability of the computation =Suppose that we want to solve a well-conditioned system of linear equations. If the LU decomposition is used, then the algorithm is unstable unless we use some sort of pivoting strategy. In the latter case, the error depends on the so-called growth factor of the matrix, which is usually (but not always) small.Now, suppose that the Cholesky decomposition is applicable. As mentioned above, the algorithm will be twice as fast. Furthermore, no pivoting is necessary, and the error will always be small. Specifically, if we want to solve Ax = b, and y denotes the computed solution, then y solves the perturbed system (A + E)y = b, where                    ‖                  E                          ‖                      2                          ≤                  c                      n                          ε        ‖                  A                          ‖                      2                          .              {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {E} \|_{2}\leq c_{n}\varepsilon \|\mathbf {A} \|_{2}.}  Here ||·||2 is the matrix 2-norm, cn is a small constant depending on n, and ε denotes the unit round-off.One concern with the Cholesky decomposition to be aware of is the use of square roots. If the matrix being factorized is positive definite as required, the numbers under the square roots are always positive in exact arithmetic. Unfortunately, the numbers can become negative because of round-off errors, in which case the algorithm cannot continue. However, this can only happen if the matrix is very ill-conditioned. One way to address this is to add a diagonal correction matrix to the matrix being decomposed in an attempt to promote the positive-definiteness. While this might lessen the accuracy of the decomposition, it can be very favorable for other reasons; for example, when performing Newton's method in optimization, adding a diagonal matrix can improve stability when far from the optimum.= LDL decomposition =An alternative form, eliminating the need to take square roots when A is symmetric, is the symmetric indefinite factorization

D and L are real if A is real.For complex Hermitian matrix A, the following formula applies:                              D                      j                          =                  A                      j            j                          −                  ∑                      k            =            1                                j            −            1                                    L                      j            k                                    L                      j            k                                ∗                                    D                      k                          ,              {\displaystyle D_{j}=A_{jj}-\sum _{k=1}^{j-1}L_{jk}L_{jk}^{*}D_{k},}                                L                      i            j                          =                              1                          D                              j                                                              (                                    A                              i                j                                      −                          ∑                              k                =                1                                            j                −                1                                                    L                              i                k                                                    L                              j                k                                            ∗                                                    D                              k                                              )                                  for                 i        >        j        .              {\displaystyle L_{ij}={\frac {1}{D_{j}}}\left(A_{ij}-\sum _{k=1}^{j-1}L_{ik}L_{jk}^{*}D_{k}\right)\quad {\text{for }}i>j.}  Again, the pattern of access allows the entire computation to be performed in-place if desired.= Block variant =When used on indefinite matrices, the LDL* factorization is known to be unstable without careful pivoting; specifically, the elements of the factorization can grow arbitrarily. A possible improvement is to perform the factorization on block sub-matrices, commonly 2 × 2:                                                                                          A

From this, these analogous recursive relations follow:                                          D                                j                          =                              A                                j            j                          −                  ∑                      k            =            1                                j            −            1                                                L                                j            k                                                D                                k                                                L                                j            k                                              T                                      ,              {\displaystyle \mathbf {D} _{j}=\mathbf {A} _{jj}-\sum _{k=1}^{j-1}\mathbf {L} _{jk}\mathbf {D} _{k}\mathbf {L} _{jk}^{\mathrm {T} },}                                            L                                i            j                          =                  (                                                    A                                            i                j                                      −                          ∑                              k                =                1                                            j                −                1                                                                    L                                            i                k                                                                    D                                            k                                                                    L                                            j                k                                                              T                                                              )                                      D                                j                                −            1                          .              {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} _{ij}=\left(\mathbf {A} _{ij}-\sum _{k=1}^{j-1}\mathbf {L} _{ik}\mathbf {D} _{k}\mathbf {L} _{jk}^{\mathrm {T} }\right)\mathbf {D} _{j}^{-1}.}  This involves matrix products and explicit inversion, thus limiting the practical block size.= Updating the decomposition =A task that often arises in practice is that one needs to update a Cholesky decomposition. In more details, one has already computed the Cholesky decomposition                               A                =                  L                                      L                                ∗                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {L} \mathbf {L} ^{*}}   of some matrix                               A                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }  , then one changes the matrix                               A                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }   in some way into another matrix, say                                                                         A                            ~                                            {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbf {A} }}}  , and one wants to compute the Cholesky decomposition of the updated matrix:                                                                         A                            ~                                      =                                                            L                            ~                                                                                                            L                                ~                                                          ∗                                {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbf {A} }}={\tilde {\mathbf {L} }}{\tilde {\mathbf {L} }}^{*}}  . The question is now whether one can use the Cholesky decomposition of                               A                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }   that was computed before to compute the Cholesky decomposition of                                                                         A                            ~                                            {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbf {A} }}}  . Rank-one update The specific case, where the updated matrix                                                                         A                            ~                                            {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbf {A} }}}   is related to the matrix                               A                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }   by                                                                         A                            ~                                      =                  A                +                  x                                      x                                ∗                                {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbf {A} }}=\mathbf {A} +\mathbf {x} \mathbf {x} ^{*}}  , is known as a rank-one update.Here is a function written in Matlab syntax that realizes a rank-one update: Rank-one downdate A rank-one downdate is similar to a rank-one update, except that the addition is replaced by subtraction:                                                                         A                            ~                                      =                  A                −                  x                                      x                                ∗                                {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbf {A} }}=\mathbf {A} -\mathbf {x} \mathbf {x} ^{*}}  . This only works if the new matrix                                                                         A                            ~                                            {\displaystyle {\tilde {\mathbf {A} }}}   is still positive definite.The code for the rank-one update shown above can easily be adapted to do a rank-one downdate: one merely needs to replace the two additions in the assignment to r and L((k+1):n, k) by subtractions. Adding and removing rows and columns If we have a symmetric and positive definite matrix                               A                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }   represented in block form

finding the Cholesky decomposition of a new matrix are all of the form                                                                         A                            ~

Proof for positive semi-definite matrices = Proof by limiting argument =The above algorithms show that every positive definite matrix                               A                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }   has a Cholesky decomposition. This result can be extended to the positive semi-definite case by a limiting argument. The argument is not fully constructive, i.e., it gives no explicit numerical algorithms for computing Cholesky factors.If                               A                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }   is an                     n        ×        n              {\displaystyle n\times n}   positive semi-definite matrix, then the sequence                                           (                                          A                                            k                                      )                                k                          :=                              (                                          A                            +                                                1                  k                                                                              I                                                  n                                                      )                                k                                {\textstyle \left(\mathbf {A} _{k}\right)_{k}:=\left(\mathbf {A} +{\frac {1}{k}}\mathbf {I} _{n}\right)_{k}}   consists of positive definite matrices. (This is an immediate consequence of, for example, the spectral mapping theorem for the polynomial functional calculus.) Also,                                          A                                k                          →                  A                                  for                        k        →        ∞              {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} _{k}\rightarrow \mathbf {A} \quad {\text{for}}\quad k\rightarrow \infty }  in operator norm.

So                                           (                                          L                                            k                                      )                                k                                {\displaystyle \left(\mathbf {L} _{k}\right)_{k}}   is a bounded set in the Banach space of operators, therefore relatively compact (because the underlying vector space is finite-dimensional). Consequently, it has a convergent subsequence, also denoted by                                           (                                          L                                            k                                      )                                k                                {\displaystyle \left(\mathbf {L} _{k}\right)_{k}}  , with limit                               L                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }  . It can be easily checked that this                               L                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }   has the desired properties, i.e.                               A                =                  L                                      L                                ∗                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {L} \mathbf {L} ^{*}}  , and                               L                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }   is lower triangular with non-negative diagonal entries: for all                     x              {\displaystyle x}   and                     y              {\displaystyle y}  ,                    ⟨                  A                x        ,        y        ⟩        =                  ⟨                      lim                                          A                                            k                                      x            ,            y                    ⟩                =        ⟨        lim                              L                                k                                                L                                k                                ∗                          x        ,        y        ⟩        =        ⟨                  L                                      L                                ∗                          x        ,        y        ⟩                .              {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {A} x,y\rangle =\left\langle \lim \mathbf {A} _{k}x,y\right\rangle =\langle \lim \mathbf {L} _{k}\mathbf {L} _{k}^{*}x,y\rangle =\langle \mathbf {L} \mathbf {L} ^{*}x,y\rangle \,.}  Therefore,                               A                =                  L                                      L                                ∗                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {L} \mathbf {L} ^{*}}  . Because the underlying vector space is finite-dimensional, all topologies on the space of operators are equivalent. So                                           (                                          L                                            k                                      )                                k                                {\displaystyle \left(\mathbf {L} _{k}\right)_{k}}   tends to                               L                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }   in norm means                                           (                                          L                                            k                                      )                                k                                {\displaystyle \left(\mathbf {L} _{k}\right)_{k}}   tends to                               L                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }   entrywise. This in turn implies that, since each                                           L                                k                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} _{k}}   is lower triangular with non-negative diagonal entries,                               L                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }   is also.= Proof by QR decomposition =Let                               A                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }   be a positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix. Then it can be written as a product of its square root matrix,                               A                =                  B                                      B                                ∗                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {A} =\mathbf {B} \mathbf {B} ^{*}}  . Now QR decomposition can be applied to                                           B                                ∗                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} ^{*}}  , resulting in                                           B                                ∗                          =                  Q                          R                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {B} ^{*}=\mathbf {Q} \mathbf {R} }  , where                               Q                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {Q} }   is unitary and                               R                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {R} }   is upper triangular. Inserting the decomposition into the original equality yields                     A        =                  B                                      B                                ∗                          =        (                  Q          R                          )                      ∗                                    Q          R                =                              R                                ∗                                                Q                                ∗                                    Q          R                =                              R                                ∗                                    R                      {\displaystyle A=\mathbf {B} \mathbf {B} ^{*}=(\mathbf {QR} )^{*}\mathbf {QR} =\mathbf {R} ^{*}\mathbf {Q} ^{*}\mathbf {QR} =\mathbf {R} ^{*}\mathbf {R} }  .
