Udaipur (pronunciation (help·info)) (ISO 15919: Udayapura), is a city in the state of Rajasthan, India.[3][4] It is the historic capital of the kingdom of Mewar in the former Rajputana Agency. It was founded in 1559 by Udai Singh II of the Sisodia clan of Rajput,[5] when he shifted his capital from the city of Chittorgarh to Udaipur after Chittorgarh was besieged by Akbar. It remained as the capital city till 1818 when it became a British princely state,[5] and thereafter the Mewar province became a part of Rajasthan when India gained independence in 1947.[6]
The city is located in the southernmost part of Rajasthan, near the Gujarat border. It is surrounded by the Aravali Range, which separates it from the Thar Desert. It is around 660 km from Delhi, approximately 800 km from Mumbai and 1720 km from Bangalore. Placed almost in the middle of two major Indian metro cities. Besides, connectivity with Gujarat ports provide Udaipur a strategic geographical advantage.[7] Udaipur is well connected with nearby cities and states by means of road, rail and air transportation facilities. The city is served by the Maharana Pratap Airport. Common languages spoken include Hindi, English and Rajasthani (Mewari).
Dubbed "the most romantic spot on the continent of India" by British administrator James Tod,[8] Udaipur is a tourist destination and is known for its history, culture, scenic locations and the Rajput-era palaces. It is popularly known as the "City of Lakes" because of its sophisticated lake system. It has seven lakes surrounding the city. Five of the major lakes, namely Fateh Sagar Lake, Lake Pichola, Swaroop Sagar Lake, Rangsagar, and Doodh Talai Lake, have been included under the restoration project of the National Lake Conservation Plan (NLCP) of the Government of India.[9] Besides lakes, Udaipur is also known for its historic forts and palaces, museums, galleries, natural locations and gardens, architectural temples, as well as traditional fairs, festivals and structures.[10] It is also known as the Venice of the east.[citation needed] Udaipur economy is primarily driven by tourism, though minerals, marble processing, chemical manufacturing and development, electronic manufacturing and the handicraft industry are also contributors.[11] Udaipur hosts several state and regional public offices, including offices of Director of Mines and Geology, Commissioner of Excise, Commissioner of Tribal Area Development, Hindustan Zinc Limited, and Rajasthan State Mines and Mineral Corporation Limited. Besides, Udaipur is rising as educational hub as well, with 5 Universities, 14 colleges and more than 160 high schools.[11] Udaipur is home to IIM Udaipur, the fifth best management institution in the country according to NIRF ranking released by the MHRD.

History[edit]
Main articles: Udaipur State and History of Udaipur
Pre-Historic Era[edit]
  Panoramic view of old city of Udaipur with City Palace behind it.
The Ahar River bank was inhabited in about 2000 BCE. There are footprints of two different civilizations, which provides claims about earliest inhabitants of the Ahar culture: the first ones are the Bhil/Bheels, the indigenous tribes originated at this place, and are still residing in the area in large numbers. The second footprints were of Rajputs, who once entered the enclosed valley, and then continued to live in this place for centuries.[12]

Establishment as a city[edit]
  Statue of Maharana Pratap of Mewar, commemorating the Battle of Haldighati.
Udaipur was founded in 1559,[5] by Maharana Udai Singh II in the fertile circular Girwa Valley to the southwest of Nagda, on the Banas River. The city was established as the new capital of the Mewar kingdom. This area already had a thriving trading town, Ayad, which had served as the capital of Mewar in the 10th through 12th centuries.[5] The Girwa region was thus already well known to Chittaud rulers who moved to it whenever the vulnerable tableland Chittaurgarh was threatened with enemy attacks. Rana Udai Singh II, in the wake of 16th-century emergence of artillery warfare, decided during his exile at Kumbhalgarh to move his capital to a more secure location. Ayad was flood-prone, hence he chose the ridge east of Pichola Lake to start his new capital city, where he came upon a hermit while hunting in the foothills of the Aravalli Range. The hermit blessed the king and guided him to build a palace on the spot, assuring him it would be well protected. Udai Singh II consequently established a residence on the site. In November 1567, the Mughal Emperor Akbar conquered Chittor. To protect Udaipur from external attacks, Rana Udai Singh built a six-kilometre-long city wall, with seven gates,[13] namely Surajpole, Chandpole, Udiapole, Hathipole, Ambapole, Brahmpole, Delhi Gate, and Kishanpole. The area within these walls and gates is still known as the old city or the walled city.
In September 1576, Akbar himself arrived at Udaipur and remained there for 6 months until May 1577.[14] In 1615, Rana Amar Singh finally accepted Mughal vassalship and Udaipur remained the capital of the state, which became a princely state of British India in 1818. Being a mountainous region and unsuitable for heavily armoured Mughal horses, Udaipur remained safe from Mughal influence despite much pressure. At present, Maharana Mahendra Singh Mewar  is the 76th custodian of the Mewar dynasty.[15]

The lake system has three main lakes in its upper catchment area, six lakes within its municipal boundary and one lake in the downstream. The Udaipur lake system, arising out of the river Berach (Banas Basin) and its tributaries, is an integral component of the upper Berach basin. The upper Berach basin is a part of the Gangetic river system, wherein the river Berach meets river Ganga through the rivers Banas, Chambal and Yamuna.[21]
The Udaipur Lake System can be divided into the following categories:[21]

Udaipur has received a rich cultural heritage from the bygone ages. The lakes, temples, huge forts, and palaces boast about the rich legacy of this city. The city has kept a balance between preserving the rituals and traditions of the past while keeping up with the modern advancements and changes in lifestyle. Like any other place in the state of Rajasthan, folk dance and music have an important place in adding to the city's cultural richness. The dynamic and vibrant dances of Bhavai, Ghoomar, Kachchhi Ghodi, Kalbeliya, and Terahtaali add a sparkle to the rich cultural heritage of Udaipur.

Ghoomar dance is a part of the royal culture of the Mewar Region of Rajasthan. This is a community dance for women and performed on auspicious occasions where the ladies move gracefully in circles.
Kalbelia, one of the most sensuous dance forms of Rajasthan, is performed by the Kalbeliya snake charmers' community with the Sapera dancers wearing long, black skirts embroidered with silver ribbons.
Bhavai dance consists of veiled women dancers balancing up to seven or nine brass pitchers as they dance nimbly, pirouetting and then swaying with the soles of their feet perched on the top of a glass or on the edge of the sword
Kachchhi Ghodi dance is performed on dummy horses where men in elaborate costumes ride the equally well decorated dummy horses. Holding naked swords, these dancers move rhythmically to the beating of drums and fifes.[47]
Following a lineage of age-old traditions and adhering to religious significance, the various dances complement the fairs and festivals held in the city.  The city's music consists mainly of the use of morchang, naad, tanpura, and sarangi, among many other instruments, that used to echo in the courts of the erstwhile rulers of the state.[48]
Miniature paintings are amongst the most famous paintings developed under the patronage of the rulers of Rajasthan. The simplest among these are done on walls, and through folk in style, they nevertheless have some of the flavors of frescoes one sees in the old palaces. The tradition of painting the wall of houses with scenes from mythological and chivalric tales has been prevalent in Rajasthan for the past many centuries. The people of the city make use of such wall paintings for decorations during wedding celebrations. Noted amongst the miniature style of paintings are particularly the Pichvais, which are those made on cloth, and phad, made on cloth scroll in a folk style.[47]
The Bharatiya Lok Kala Mandal is a cultural institution based in the city. The institute with its museum is a platform that displays a collection of Rajasthani culture. Offering an insight into the lifestyle of the royal era in Udaipur, the museum has a fine collection of dresses, tribal jewelry, turbans, dolls, masks, musical instruments, paintings, and puppets. With various cultural events including folk song and dance performances, theatre and puppetry, the institute highlights the different social stigmas, thereby proving to be a powerful education tool for the masses.[49][50]

Festivals[edit]
Gangaur Festival[edit]
Gangaur is one of the most important local festivals in Rajasthan.[51] In some form or the other it is celebrated all over Rajasthan.[52] "gan" is a synonym for Lord Shiva and "Gauri" or "gaur" stands for Goddess Parvati, the heavenly consort of Lord Shiva. Gangaur celebrates the union of the two and is a symbol of conjugal and marital happiness.
It is celebrated in the month of Chaitra (March–April), the first month of the Hindu calendar. This month marks the end of winter and the onset of spring.
This festival is celebrated especially by women, who worship clay idols of "Gan" & "Gauri" in their houses. These idols are worshiped by the girls who seek the blessings of Gan and Gauri for a good spouse, while the married women pray for the good health and long life of their husbands.
On the eve of the Gangaur festival, women decorate their palms and fingers with henna.
Udaipur has the privilege of having a dedicated Ghat named after Gangaur. Gangaur Ghat or Gangori Ghat is situated on the waterfront of Lake Pichola. This ghat serves as a prime location for the celebration of multiple festivals, including the Gangaur festival. The idols of Gan and Gauri are immersed in the Lake Pichola from this ghat.
A traditional procession of Gangaur commences from the City Palace which passes through various areas of the city. The procession is headed by old palanquins, chariots, bullock carts, and performance by folk artists.

Shilpgram Utsav[edit]
Shilpgram, a crafts village 3  km west of Lake Fateh Sagar, has displays of traditional houses from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Goa, and Maharashtra. There are also demonstrations by musicians, dancers, or artisans from these states. The 10-day festival organized here[53] is a treat for the visitor to an array of exquisite art and craft. One of the important objectives of the Shilpgram festival is in the sphere of increasing awareness and knowledge of rural life and crafts, specifically, for the younger generation. Special emphasis is laid on workshops for children on arts, crafts, theatre, and music.

Hariyali Amavasya[edit]
Hariyali Amavasya (new moon day of the Sawan / Shravan month) marks the beginning of the monsoons and greenery. It arrives three days before the famous Hartalika Teej (Shravan Shukla Tritiya). People worship God Shiva for abundant rains and good agricultural season. Melas and fests are arranged in several places in the city.

Jagannath Rath Yatra[edit]
In Udaipur, the third biggest Ratha-Yatra[54] is organized on the auspicious day of Ashadh Shukla Paksha (bright fortnight) Dwitiya according to Indian Vikram Samvat. On this cultural day of summer solstice theme, June 21 of every year, the journey of the Lord Jagannath to their aunt's house is started. The presiding deities of the temple lord Jagannath (Krishna), Balabhadra (Balarama) and their sister Subhadra are taken through the streets in heavily decorated wooden chariots, which are made every year for the purpose. The Chariot of Lord Jagannath, called Nandighosha, has 16 wheels and is draped in red and yellow.
The sanctity of the festival is such that even a touch of the chariot or even the ropes with which these are pulled is considered enough to confer the results of several pious deeds or penance for ages.

Jal-Jhulni Ekadashi[edit]
According to the Hindu calendar, Gyaras, or Ekadashi is basically, the 11th day of each waxing (Shukla paksha ) and waning moon (Krishna paksha). This Ekadashi, known as Jal-Jhulni Gyaras, or Jal-Jhulni Ekadashi, like all other festivals, is celebrated with great enthusiasm in Udaipur.
