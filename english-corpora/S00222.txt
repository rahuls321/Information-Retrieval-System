The list excludes works that were alternate histories, which were composed after the dates they depict, alternative futures, as depicted in time travel fiction, as well as any works that make no predictions of the future, such as those focusing solely on the future lives of specific fictional characters, or works which, despite their claimed dates, are contemporary in all but name. Entries referencing the current year may be added if their month and day were not specified or have already occurred.

Even if Activision is reluctant to go that far back in time, a simple return to a modern setting could potentially do wonders for the franchise. The Modern Warfare trilogy proved so popular because it, despite being a little outlandish at times, was rooted in the real world. The games took players to real locations, from the streets of New York City to the favelas of Brazil, to the war-torn Middle East and the ruins of Chernobyl. Those places all have real history behind them, a history that game developers can play with to craft new tales of sacrifice and daring.
