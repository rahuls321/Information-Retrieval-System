Mathematics is a field of study that investigates topics such as number, space, structure, and change. Philosophy = Nature =Definitions of mathematics – Mathematics has no generally accepted definition. Different schools of thought, particularly in philosophy, have put forth radically different definitions, all of which are controversial.Language of mathematics is the system used by mathematicians to communicate mathematical ideas among themselves, and is distinct from natural languages in that it aims to communicate abstract, logical ideas with precision and unambiguity.Philosophy of mathematics – its aim is to provide an account of the nature and methodology of mathematics and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives.Classical mathematics refers generally to the mainstream approach to mathematics, which is based on classical logic and ZFC set theory.Constructive mathematics asserts that it is necessary to find (or "construct") a mathematical object to prove that it exists. In classical mathematics, one can prove the existence of a mathematical object without "finding" that object explicitly, by assuming its non-existence and then deriving a contradiction from that assumption.Predicative mathematics= Mathematics is =An academic discipline – branch of knowledge that is taught at all levels of education and researched typically at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.A formal science – branch of knowledge concerned with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules of inference. Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the physical world.= Concepts =Mathematical object — an abstract concept in mathematics; an object is anything that has been (or could be) formally defined, and with which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. Each branch of mathematics has its own objects.Mathematical structure — a set endowed with some additional features on the set (e.g., operation, relation, metric, topology). A partial list of possible structures are measures, algebraic structures (groups, fields, etc.), topologies, metric structures (geometries), orders, events, equivalence relations, differential structures, and categories.Equivalent definitions of mathematical structuresAbstraction — the process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns or properties of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena. Branches and subjects = Quantity =Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions.Arithmetic — (from the Greek ἀριθμός arithmos, 'number' and τική [τέχνη], tiké [téchne], 'art') is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers and the properties of the traditional mathematical operations on them.Elementary arithmetic is the part of arithmetic which deals with basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.Modular arithmeticSecond-order arithmetic is a collection of axiomatic systems that formalize the natural numbers and their subsets.Peano axioms also known as the Dedekind–Peano axioms or the Peano postulates, are axioms for the natural numbers presented by the 19th century Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano.Floating-point arithmetic is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation to support a trade-off between range and precision.Numbers — a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label.List of types of numbersNatural number, Integer, Rational number, Real number, Irrational number, Imaginary number, Complex number, Hypercomplex number, p-adic numberNegative number, Positive number, Parity (mathematics)Prime number, Composite number0, Zero, InfinitesimalsList of numbers in various languagesNumeral system, Unary numeral system, Numeral prefix, List of numeral systems, List of numeral system topicsCounting, Number line, Numerical digitRadix, Radix economy, Base (exponentiation), Table of basesMathematical notation, Infix notation, Scientific notation, Positional notation, Notation in probability and statistics, History of mathematical notation, List of mathematical notation systemsInfinity, Hyperreal numbers, Surreal numbersFractions, Decimal, Decimal separatorOperation (mathematics) — an operation is a mathematical function which takes zero or more input values called operands, to a well-defined output value. The number of operands is the arity of the operation.Calculation, Computation, Expression (mathematics), Order of operations, AlgorithmTypes of Operations: Binary operation, Unary operation, Nullary operationOperands: Order of operations, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponentiation, Logarithm, RootFunction (mathematics), Inverse functionCommutative property, Anticommutative property, Associative property, Additive identity, Distributive propertySummation, Product (mathematics), Divisor, Quotient, Greatest common divisor, Quotition and partition, Remainder, Fractional partSubtraction without borrowing, Long division, Short division, Modulo operation, Chunking (division), Multiplication and repeated addition, Euclidean division, Division by zeroPlus and minus signs, Multiplication sign, Division sign, Equals signEquality (mathematics), Inequality (mathematics), Logical equivalenceRatioVariable (mathematics), Constant (mathematics)Measurement= Structure =AlgebraAbstract algebraLinear algebraList of linear algebra topicsNumber theoryOrder theoryFunction (mathematics)= Space =GeometryAlgebraic geometryList of algebraic geometry topicsTrigonometryDifferential geometryTopologyFractal geometry= Change =CalculusVector calculusDifferential equationsDynamical systemsChaos theoryAnalysis= Foundations and philosophy =Philosophy of mathematicsCategory theorySet theoryType theory= Mathematical logic =Model theoryProof theorySet theoryType theoryRecursion theoryTheory of ComputationList of logic symbolsSecond-order arithmetic is a collection of axiomatic systems that formalize the natural numbers and their subsets.Peano axioms also known as the Dedekind–Peano axioms or the Peano postulates, are axioms for the natural numbers presented by the 19th century Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano.= Discrete mathematics =Combinatorics (outline)CryptographyGraph theory= Applied mathematics =Mathematical chemistryMathematical physicsAnalytical mechanicsMathematical fluid dynamicsNumerical analysisControl theoryDynamical systemsMathematical optimizationOperations researchProbabilityStatisticsGame theoryEngineering mathematicsMathematical economicsFinancial mathematicsInformation theoryCryptographyMathematical biology History = Regional history == Subject history = Psychology Mathematics educationNumeracyNumerical CognitionSubitizingMathematical anxietyDyscalculiaAcalculiaAgeometresiaNumber senseNumerosity adaptation effectApproximate number systemMathematical maturity Influential mathematicians See Lists of mathematicians.

Journals and databases Mathematical Reviews – journal and online database published by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) that contains brief synopses (and occasionally evaluations) of many articles in mathematics, statistics and theoretical computer science.Zentralblatt MATH – service providing reviews and abstracts for articles in pure and applied mathematics, published by Springer Science+Business Media. It is a major international reviewing service which covers the entire field of mathematics. It uses the Mathematics Subject Classification codes for organizing their reviews by topic.
