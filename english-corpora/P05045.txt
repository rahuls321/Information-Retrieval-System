Thereafter, those seven sons of his chief minister having a lustre similar to that of fire, surrounded by a great army, wielding their respective bows, possessing a great strength, well-trained in archery and the best among knower of weapons, wishing a victory reciprocally, having an immense prowess each, and as directed by Ravana, started highly delighted from that palace, in great chariots yoked with horses. Those chariots were having a noise similar to that of an autumnal cloud, overlaid with a protective armour of gold, surmounted by banners and decorated with smaller flags. They were stretching their bows inlaid with refined gold and looking colourful like clouds accompanied by flashes of lightning.Coming to know that Kimkaras themselves were killed their mothers together with their relatives and friends were tormented with grief.Those sons of chief minister, wearing ornaments made of pure gold, rushed towards Hanuma, who was ready for battle and who stood on the archy gate-way motionless.Those demons looking like clouds, diffusing thunder-like sounds of their chariots and discharging a shower of arrows, moved in different directions resembling rainy clouds in the monsoon.Thus covered by those showers of arrows, Hanuma became invisible even as a mountain-king is concealed by incessant showers.Roaming about in a cloudless sky, that fast-footed monkey made the arrows and the speedy chariots of those virile demons, useless.Playing with those demons wielding a bow each in the sky, that hero shone like the Lord of Wind, playing with clouds brandishing a rain bow.Making a terrific roar and frightening that great army, the valiant Hanuma rushed on those demons.That Hanuma, the annihilator of enemies, struck some with his palms, some with his feet and some others with his fists. He tore down some others with his nails.Hanuma crushed some with his chest and some others with his thighs. Some fell down there itself on the ground, just by the roar made by Hanuma.Seeing those demons dying and falling on the ground, all the remaining army, afflicted with fear, fled in ten different directions.Their elephants trumpeted with a wrong accent. Horses fell down on the ground. Even the earth was filled with chariots which had their seats, banners and canopies broken.Thereafter, streams flowing with blood were seen on the way. Lanka resounded with various kinds of horrible voices.That heroic and mighty Hanuma having a terrible prowess, killing those arrogant demons and being desirous of a combat with the other demons, again reached that archy door way itself.
