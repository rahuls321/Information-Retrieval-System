The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Indonesian: Kementerian Pendidikan, Kebudayaan, Riset, dan Teknologi, abbreviated Kemdikbudristek) is a government ministry of the Indonesian government responsible for education, cultural, research and technology affairs. Its formation resulted from the merger of the Ministry of Education and Culture and the Ministry of Research and Technology in April 2021, under the government of President Joko Widodo.[1]

On 30 March 2021, President Joko Widodo submitted a Presidential Letter to People's Representative Council, which contained a proposal for major changes in the national cabinet, one of which was the merger of the Ministry of Research and Technology and the Ministry of Education and Culture into one ministry named Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology. The National Research and Innovation Agency (Indonesian: Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional, abbreviated BRIN) were to be separated as a new non-ministerial agency.[1]
On 9 April 2021, People's Representative Council approved the proposal, along with the creation of the new Ministry of Investment.[2] On 13 April 2021, Ali Mochtar Ngabalin, spokesperson for and specialist of the Presidential Staff Office, announced that a second reshuffle of the Onward Indonesia Cabinet will take place on second week of April 2021.[3] The reshuffle was finally announced at 28 April 2021. It was the first of its kind, because not only were the ministers reshuffled, but cabinet institutions were also disbanded mid-term. In this reshuffle, Nadiem Makarim was appointed as the first Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, according to the Presidential Decision No. 72/P/2021.[4][5] On the same day, the President formally recognized the ministry as one of the 34 Indonesian government ministries.[6]
On 30 July 2021, President Widodo issued the permanent constituting document of the ministry, Presidential Decree No. 62 of 2021.[7] The decree itself backdated to 15 July 2021.[8]

Initially, the organizational structure of the ministry was a direct merger of the structures of the two preceding cabinet ministries.[11] However, the structure was deemed too large and ineffective.   
On 23 August 2021, the structure of the Ministry was expanded by Ministerial Decree No. 28/2021 into:[12]

A smaller version of the ministry, the General Directorate of Higher Education, Research, and Technology, was created within the ministry in pursuance of Presidential Decree No. 62 of 2021, to govern and regulate science, research, and technology in Indonesia after dismantlement of Ministry of Research and Technology.[8] Despite that, the coordination between the ministry and the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) was not yet made clear in the constituting document. Minister Nadiem Makarim asserted that BRIN is a partner of the ministry in performing researches, and not a subordinate of the ministry.[13] While the presidential decree did not clearly separate the scope of the limitation of the ministry and coordination with BRIN, the Ministerial Decree No. 28 of 2021 distinguished BRIN as a separate entity and clearly outlined the ministry's power in regulating scientific, research, and technology affairs, confirming Makarim's statement.[12] The ministerial decree also confirmed the relinquishment of its National Archaeology Research Institute to BRIN.[12]

Reception[edit]
General secretary of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle Hasto Kristiyanto praised the move. With the merger, he hoped that the now independent BRIN would play an important role in accelerating the growth of research in Indonesia.[14] The Deputy Chief of Commission X in the People's Representative Council, Hetifah Syaifudian of Golkar, also praised the move. She commented that such fusion might helping the research synergy between academia and research agencies.[15]

Criticism[edit]
Deputy chief of the Prosperous Justice Party fraction in the People's Representative Council Mulyanto from the opposition criticized the decision taken by government and said that the change is not effective. He claimed that government not learned from the previous experience when combining Ministry of Research and Technology with General Directorate of Higher Education to form Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education. While the ministry was successfully formed, Mulyanto claimed that the ministry was not effective when combined to manage research and technology development and educational affairs. He also cited that in previous cabinet, the administrative migration and adaptation processes in a new ministry required at least three years. Not only that, the presence of the non-ministerial National Research and Innovation Agency to coordinate and facilitate state research and development, would result in an overlap with some of the tasks of the ministry.[16]
The governing coalition also voiced criticisms. While the Chief of Commission X in the People's Representative Council, Syaiful Huda of the National Awakening Party praised the move, he criticized the timing of the formation of the new ministry, happening in the middle of the second term of the ruling government, when normally such a major change would have been done earlier. Citing the issue of lengthy administrative migration and adaptation processes, Huda urged that the transitional process must be done as soon as possible, in a maximum time of one year after the formation of the new ministry, stressing the importance of research during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also commented that such a merger will put heavy load to the new ministry because both of preceding ministries had very different focuses.[17][15]
In the aftermath of the release of the Presidential Decree No. 62 of 2021, the formation of the General Directorate of Higher Education, Research, and Technology was also criticized by officials of the ministry. An official from the Quality Control Department, Johannes Gunawan, criticized the government for not learning from failures of the past, citing past mismanagement of expert personnel.[18]
