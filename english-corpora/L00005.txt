In 2004 copyright in Australia changed from a "plus 50" law to a "plus 70" law, in line with America and the European Union. But the change was not made retroactive (unlike the 1995 change in the European Union which brought some British authors back into copyright, especially those who died from 1925 to 1944). Hence the work of an author who died before 1955 is normally in the public domain in Australia; but the copyright of authors was extended to 70 years after death for those who died in 1955 or later, and no more Australian authors will come out of copyright until 1 January 2026 (those who died in 1955).[1]

Countries with life + 80 years[edit]
Spain, Colombia and Equatorial Guinea has a copyright term of life + 80 years. For Spain this is for creators who died before 1987. The list is sorted alphabetically and includes a notable work of the creator's that entered the public domain on 1 January 2022.

All sheet music published in 1926 entered the public domain.[2] Under the Music Modernization Act, tens of thousands of sound recordings that were published before 1923 entered the public domain on 1 January 2022.[3][4] The Library of Congress says that this will result in "Increased public and online access to previously unavailable recordings and expanded opportunities to explore the earliest days of our sound recording heritage."[3] Sound recordings that were first published after December 31, 1922 have not yet entered the public domain.[5]
Under the Copyright Term Extension Act, books published in 1926, films released in 1926, like Don Juan (one of the early sound films), The Son of the Sheik (Rudolph Valentino's final film), and other works published in 1926, entered the public domain in 2022.[6]
Notable books entering the public domain in the United States include The Sun Also Rises, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Winnie-the-Pooh, Seven Pillars of Wisdom, and Bambi, a Life in the Woods.[7]
Unpublished works whose authors died in 1951 entered the public domain.
