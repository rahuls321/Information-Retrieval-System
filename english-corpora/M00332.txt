In geometry, a normal is an object such as a line, ray, or vector that is perpendicular to a given object. For example, the normal line to a plane curve at a given point is the (infinite) line perpendicular to the tangent line to the curve at the point.A normal vector may have length one (a unit vector) or its length may represent the curvature of the object (a curvature vector); its algebraic sign may indicate sides (interior or exterior).In three dimensions, a surface normal, or simply normal, to a surface at point                     P              {\displaystyle P}   is a vector perpendicular to the tangent plane of the surface at P. The word "normal" is also used as an adjective: a line normal to a plane, the normal component of a force, the normal vector, etc. The concept of normality generalizes to orthogonality (right angles).The concept has been generalized to differentiable manifolds of arbitrary dimension embedded in a Euclidean space. The normal vector space or normal space of a manifold at point                     P              {\displaystyle P}   is the set of vectors which are orthogonal to the tangent space at                     P        .              {\displaystyle P.}  Normal vectors are of special interest in the case of smooth curves and smooth surfaces.The normal is often used in 3D computer graphics (notice the singular, as only one normal will be defined) to determine a surface's orientation toward a light source for flat shading, or the orientation of each of the surface's corners (vertices) to mimic a curved surface with Phong shading.The normal distance of a point Q to a curve or to a surface is the Euclidean distance between Q and its perpendicular projection on the object (at the point P on the object where the normal contains Q). The normal distance is a type of perpendicular distance generalizing the distance from a point to a line and the distance from a point to a plane. It can be used for curve fitting and for defining offset surfaces. Normal to surfaces in 3D space = Calculating a surface normal =For a convex polygon (such as a triangle), a surface normal can be calculated as the vector cross product of two (non-parallel) edges of the polygon.For a plane given by the equation                     a        x        +        b        y        +        c        z        +        d        =        0        ,

F(x,y,z)=\left(-{\tfrac {\partial f}{\partial x}},-{\tfrac {\partial f}{\partial y}},1\right).}   Since a surface does not have a tangent plane at a singular point, it has no well-defined normal at that point: for example, the vertex of a cone. In general, it is possible to define a normal almost everywhere for a surface that is Lipschitz continuous.= Choice of normal =The normal to a (hyper)surface is usually scaled to have unit length, but it does not have a unique direction, since its opposite is also a unit normal. For a surface which is the topological boundary of a set in three dimensions, one can distinguish between the inward-pointing normal and outer-pointing normal. For an oriented surface, the normal is usually determined by the right-hand rule or its analog in higher dimensions.If the normal is constructed as the cross product of tangent vectors (as described in the text above), it is a pseudovector.= Transforming normals =When applying a transform to a surface it is often useful to derive normals for the resulting surface from the original normals.Specifically, given a 3×3 transformation matrix                               M                ,              {\displaystyle \mathbf {M} ,}   we can determine the matrix                               W                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {W} }   that transforms a vector                               n                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} }   perpendicular to the tangent plane                               t                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} }   into a vector                                           n                                ′                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} ^{\prime }}   perpendicular to the transformed tangent plane                               M          t                ,              {\displaystyle \mathbf {Mt} ,}   by the following logic:Write n′ as                               W          n                .              {\displaystyle \mathbf {Wn} .}   We must find                               W                .              {\displaystyle \mathbf {W} .}  Choosing                               W                      {\displaystyle \mathbf {W} }   such that                                W                                    T                                      M        =        I        ,              {\displaystyle W^{\mathrm {T} }M=I,}   or                     W        =        (                  M                      −            1                                    )                                    T                                      ,              {\displaystyle W=(M^{-1})^{\mathrm {T} },}   will satisfy the above equation, giving a                     W                  n                      {\displaystyle W\mathbb {n} }   perpendicular to                     M                  t                ,              {\displaystyle M\mathbb {t} ,}   or an                                           n                                ′                                {\displaystyle \mathbf {n} ^{\prime }}   perpendicular to                                           t                                ′                          ,              {\displaystyle \mathbf {t} ^{\prime },}   as required.Therefore, one should use the inverse transpose of the linear transformation when transforming surface normals. The inverse transpose is equal to the original matrix if the matrix is orthonormal, that is, purely rotational with no scaling or shearing.

Uses Surface normals are useful in defining surface integrals of vector fields.Surface normals are commonly used in 3D computer graphics for lighting calculations (see Lambert's cosine law), often adjusted by normal mapping.Render layers containing surface normal information may be used in Digital compositing to change the apparent lighting of rendered elements.In computer vision, the shapes of 3D objects are estimated from surface normals using photometric stereo. Normal in geometric optics The normal ray is the outward-pointing ray perpendicular to the surface of an optical medium at a given point. In reflection of light, the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are respectively the angle between the normal and the incident ray (on the plane of incidence) and the angle between the normal and the reflected ray.
