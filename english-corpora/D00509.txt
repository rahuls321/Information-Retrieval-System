Early life[edit]
Varshavski was born on November 12, 1989, in Saransk, Russia to a Jewish family.[4][5]  His father was a physician, a graduate of the Third Medical Institute of Moscow,[6] while his mother was a mathematics professor. When he was six, he and his family emigrated to Brooklyn.[7] In Brooklyn, his mother had to work sweeping floors for minimum wage, while his father attended medical school for the second time.[7]
Varshavski was given the nickname "Doctor Mike" during his high school years by friends who came to him for sports-related injuries, knowing that Varshavski's father is a physician.[8] After seeing his father's relationship with his patients, he wanted to become a doctor.[9] He enrolled in the New York Institute of Technology and was accepted for an accelerated, seven-year combined track for a bachelor's degree in life sciences and a medical degree (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine) upon completion of the undergraduate program. In 2014, he started residency at Atlantic Health System Overlook Medical Center’s Family Medicine program,[10] completing in 2017. During his first year in the program, his mother died of leukemia.[9] He decided to move back in with his father.[9][11]

Career[edit]
In early 2012, Varshavski joined Instagram to document his life as a medical student and combat the notion that "you can't have a life in medical school".[9][12][13]
Varshavski gained media attention in August 2015 when Buzzfeed published an article about him titled "Um, You Really Need To See This Hot Doctor And His Dog" that highlighted his good looks and his relationship with his dog, a husky named Roxy.[14] That November, People magazine named him "the Sexiest Doctor Alive" in its Sexiest Man Alive issue,[10] popularizing his Instagram account.[4] He lived on Staten Island at the time.[4]
In late 2015, Varshavski established a foundation, Limitless Tomorrow, to provide scholarships to students, and he has raised money for it by auctioning experiences with himself through his social media accounts.[13][15] In January 2016, the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel collaborated in a $10 raffle for a date with Varshavski; the campaign raised $91,000 for his foundation.[16]
In 2017, a year after he launched his YouTube channel, Varshavski gave a TEDx Talk on "The epidemic of the 'I Know It All' expert" at a TEDxMonteCarlo event. The video of that speech has been viewed nearly 2 million times.[17] In 2018, after his residency, he joined Chatham Family Medicine, a family practice with Atlantic Health System, in Chatham, New Jersey.[18]
On November 12, 2020,[19] for his 31st birthday, Varshavski traveled to Miami to attend a beach party that was also attended by a number of other people without masks, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Footage of the event was posted on Instagram and went viral, particularly on Reddit.[20] On November 18, Varshavski uploaded an apology video on a tertiary channel not linked on his main channel saying, "I messed up. [...] I need to do better."[21] His attendance of the party was criticized by several medical professionals in an article published on Medscape.[22]

Philanthropy[edit]
In July 2019, Varshavski spread awareness for the humanitarian organization, Save a Child's Heart, by posting a photo with the organization's 5,000th patient while on a trip to Israel.[23]
In March 2020, he donated $50,000 worth of N95 masks in the face of shortages for medical personnel due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[24]

Awards and nominations[edit]
Varshavski won the 2020 Webby Awards for Education & Discovery, as well as for Health & Fitness in the category Social.[25]
