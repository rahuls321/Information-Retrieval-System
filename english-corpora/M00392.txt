In mathematics, specifically in functional analysis and Hilbert space theory, the fundamental theorem of Hilbert spaces gives a necessarily and sufficient condition for a Hausdorff pre-Hilbert space to be a Hilbert space in terms of the canonical isometry of a pre-Hilbert space into its anti-dual.  Preliminaries = Antilinear functionals and the anti-dual =Suppose that H is a topological vector space (TVS). A function f : H → ℂ is called semilinear or antilinear  if for all x, y ∈ H and all scalars c ,Additive: f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y);Conjugate homogeneous: f (c x) = c f (x).The vector space of all continuous antilinear functions on H is called the anti-dual space or complex conjugate dual space of H and is denoted by                                                         H              ¯                                            ′                                {\displaystyle {\overline {H}}^{\prime }}   (in contrast, the continuous dual space of H is denoted by                               H                      ′                                {\displaystyle H^{\prime }}  ), which we make into a normed space by endowing it with the canonical norm (defined in the same way as the canonical norm on the continuous dual space of H).= Pre-Hilbert spaces and sesquilinear forms =A sesquilinear form is a map B : H × H → ℂ such that for all y ∈ H, the map defined by x ↦ B(x, y) is linear, and for all x ∈ H, the map defined by y ↦ B(x, y) is antilinear.  Note that in Physics, the convention is that a sesquilinear form is linear in its second coordinate and antilinear in its first coordinate. A sesquilinear form on H is called positive definite if B(x, x) > 0 for all non-0 x ∈ H; it is called non-negative if B(x, x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ H.  A sesquilinear form B on H is called a Hermitian form if in addition it has the property that                     B        (        x        ,        y        )        =                                            B              (              y              ,              x              )                        ¯                                {\displaystyle B(x,y)={\overline {B(y,x)}}}   for all x, y ∈ H.= Pre-Hilbert and Hilbert spaces =A pre-Hilbert space is a pair consisting of a vector space H and a non-negative sesquilinear form B on H; if in addition this sesquilinear form B is positive definite then (H, B) is called a Hausdorff pre-Hilbert space.  If B is non-negative then it induces a canonical seminorm on H, denoted by                     ‖        ⋅        ‖              {\displaystyle \|\cdot \|}  , defined by x ↦ B(x, x)1/2, where if B is also positive definite then this map is a norm.  This canonical semi-norm makes every pre-Hilbert space into a seminormed space and every Hausdorff pre-Hilbert space into a normed space. The sesquilinear form B : H × H → ℂ is separately uniformly continuous in each of its two arguments and hence can be extended to a separately continuous sesquilinear form on the completion of H; if H is Hausdorff then this completion is a Hilbert space. A Hausdorff pre-Hilbert space that is complete is called a Hilbert space.= Canonical map into the anti-dual =Suppose (H, B) is a pre-Hilbert space. If h ∈ H, we define the canonical maps:B(h, •) : H → ℂ       where       y ↦ B(h, y),     andB(•, h) : H → ℂ       where       x ↦ B(x, h)The canonical map  from H into its anti-dual                                                         H              ¯                                            ′                                {\displaystyle {\overline {H}}^{\prime }}   is the map                     H        →                                            H              ¯                                            ′                                {\displaystyle H\to {\overline {H}}^{\prime }}         defined by       x ↦ B(x, •).If (H, B) is a pre-Hilbert space then this canonical map is linear and continuous; this map is an isometry onto a vector subspace of the anti-dual if and only if (H, B) is a Hausdorff pre-Hilbert.There is of course a canonical antilinear surjective isometry                               H                      ′                          →                                            H              ¯                                            ′                                {\displaystyle H^{\prime }\to {\overline {H}}^{\prime }}   that sends a continuous linear functional f on H to the continuous antilinear functional denoted by  f  and defined by x ↦  f (x). Fundamental theorem Fundamental theorem of Hilbert spaces:  Suppose that (H, B) is a Hausdorff pre-Hilbert space where B : H × H → ℂ is a sesquilinear form that is linear in its first coordinate and antilinear in its second coordinate. Then the canonical linear mapping from H into the anti-dual space of H is surjective if and only if (H, B) is a Hilbert space, in which case the canonical map is a surjective isometry of H onto its anti-dual.
