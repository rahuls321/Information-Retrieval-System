Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary is in Canacona, India.


Understand[edit]Goa's second-largest wildlife sanctuary is at Cotigao. It's terrain is fairly plain, with hills in the south and east -- at one very end of Goa. Much of the sanctuary is covered with dense forests, with a few open grass lands. Forest crown density is often over 50%. Some trees, Goa's loftiest, touch 30 metres. If you go with the intention of seeing some of Indiaâ€™s legendary fauna here, then you could be in for a disappointment, as spotting the more famous wild animals is not extremely common. But the expansive forestland is a welcome change.

Fees and permits[edit]
Get around[edit][add listing]
See[edit][add listing]Expect difficulty in spotting animals due to the dense undergrowth, and the fact that they could be scattered across this sanctuary's 86 sq km. You'll need patience and getting atop one of the watch-towers. Villagers have reported sighting tigers, gaur (Indian bison). Birds are aplenty. Some 200 species could be spotted, given time and patience. These include the Indian pied hornbill, larger golden backed woodpecker and the great Indian woodpecker.
