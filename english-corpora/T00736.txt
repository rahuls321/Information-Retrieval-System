This park extends into Bangladesh - for that section see Sundarbans
Sundarbans National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Southeast Bengal, India.


Understand[edit]  A broad, tree-lined river in the parkSundarbans National Park is marked as the Core area of  Sundarban tiger reserve in Sundarban Reserve Forest. Sundarbans Reserve Forest is located in southern part of South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India. The meaning of the Bengali word sundarban is "beautiful forest". Sundarbans is a plastic free zone, so if you bring any plastic with you, remember to take it out when you leave.
History[edit]The Sundarbans are the largest littoral mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland from the coast. The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park. The forests aren't just mangrove swamps though — they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles which once covered the Gangetic plain. The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered in water/marsh areas. Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The forest is called 'Sunderban' due to the rich growth of Sundari trees.

 Sundaban Residency, toll-free: 1800 103 9161. editIf you are backpacking, go to Godhkhali/Pakhirala and inquire about the boats. They are generally cheaper, but there is always the risk that you may not get one on weekend and important dates and have to abandon your tour from there. 
Overnight stay on the boat,is possible and is a unique experience. However check out the hygiene and safety of the boat before you do so. Most of the boats have single toilets and the toilets on the boats stink and may not be so clean as most of the boats carry maximum number of passengers (25, 35, 40 or maybe 60) as per their Licensed capacity during the day and all those passengers use on-board bathrooms.
However, if you find one such nice boat, the experience of overnight stay on the boat and the scenic beauty of the dawn on the water is absolutely breathtaking and mesmerizing. 
Always insist or inquire whether the boat you would be traveling has life jackets, lifebuoys, fire extinguishers and other fire fighting measures" as those are minimum prerequisite safety measures (most of the boats do not have them). So be very careful in planning your trip in small boats. You may endanger your life by availing the services of such small boats which do not have these safety measures.





Stay safe[edit]The Sundarbans are the only place in the world where tigers still actively hunt humans for food and usually between 50 and 80 locals are mauled per year. The royal Bengal tiger is extremely dangerous in the Sundarbans, but most visitors need not worry since wildlife tours and accommodation that is provided by state government will never put you in harm's way; however if you are interested in a private tour (by hiring a small machine boat), do it at your own risk! The Sundarbans are also home to a population of saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) and bullsharks are found throughout the estuaries, so swimming is not advised anywhere.
