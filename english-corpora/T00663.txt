Pune  (formerly spelt Poona) is in Maharashtra, India. It is considered the state's cultural capital and is the second largest city in the state.
Pune is known for its educational tourism and has a blend of cultural, business, health, cuisine tourism background. The large student population in the city makes for a lively nightlife and vibrant atmosphere. Pune also houses fantastic restaurants, good museums, and hill forts which offer panoramic views.


Understand[edit]
  Pu La Deshpande Garden
Since Pune is in the state of Maharashtra, most of the residents are Marathis (or Maharashtrians). The city contains the headquarters of the Pune administrative division. Pune has history that stretches back nearly 1600 years. Pataleshwar caves (Near Jangli Maharaj Road) from the 5th century are evidence to Pune's old settlements.
Pune is a gateway to knowledge about the past with opportunities to learn from the help of forts, monuments, museums and higher-learning institutions. From the medieval Maratha history of King Shivaji to a visit to Aga Khan Palace to learn about Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent freedom struggle, there is much to learn here. If the quote "Freedom is my birthright and I shall have it!" sounds interesting, make a visit to Gayakwadwada museum. If interested in ancient Indian history or Indology, then Deccan college, Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute are the places of research and learning and house their own museums as well.
Pune has been called the "Oxford of the East". It is a university town. There are many colleges and institutes here that offer everything from engineering to fine arts. These establishments boast a large number of foreign students in addition to locals.

Climate[edit]
  Osho Garden
The climate of Pune is quite pleasant. Pune has three distinct seasons: summer, monsoon and winter. Summers are typically hot with maximum temperatures ranging from 35 to 42°C. The warmest month in Pune is generally April as compared to the rest of the Deccan Plateau where it is May.
Pune does not get very hot. Even during the peak of summer the air is cool and standing under a tree can give respite from the heat. However, as the frequent sunlight can cause sunburn, be sure to carry and use sunscreens (above SPF-30). The nights in Pune are significantly cooler than most other parts in this region due to its high altitude.
The average rainfall is approx 550mm. The city often receives thundershowers with heavy downpours in May, which brings down the temperature. The rainy season can sometimes be gloomy, with cloud cover for many days in a row. In winter, day temperatures can be as low as 24 - 28°C and temperatures at night as low as 5 - 8°C. Winters are generally dry. Normally, the climate in Pune is pleasant during the month of November.

Attitude[edit]
Attitudes in Pune are liberal. The city used to be very traditional and conservative, but times have changed. The city is not the conservative small-town of old, but now is a much more open-minded developed city.

For arrivals, there is a money exchange stand, a duty-free shop and a pre-paid taxi stall; in airside departures there are snack stalls and a duty-free store. The business lounge is basic.

By bus[edit]



Buses: Government operated versus Privately operated 

Tourists travelling between Pune and Mumbai are advised to travel by the state government run buses (MSRTC "Shivneri" bus; online reservations available) wherever possible. These Volvo buses cost almost the same (₹320) as the private buses and they have less stops during the journey since private buses try to pick passengers on the way. Buses run very frequently (every 15 mins) and are also punctual. You can be sure of reaching your destination within the stipulated time. Most of the private buses wait until they get enough passengers before departing, which can cause delays. When arriving at the bus depot, beware of touts trying to direct you to the wrong bus and clarify you're looking for the Shivneri.


It takes about three hours to get from the Mumbai airport to Pune via the Pune-Mumbai Expressway. Private and state-owned companies (MSRTC) operate luxury buses on this route, and run 24 hours service with buses departing every fifteen minutes. MSRTC buses charge approximately ₹200 (Non AC) and ₹420 (AC) for the journey. The MSRTC A/C "Shivneri" buses operate between 5:30AM - midnight. Below are arrival and departure points for buses from cities and villages outside of Pune.

18.52784873.8727093 MSRTC Bus Depot Pune Station, Sanjay Gandhi Rd, Agarkar Nagar. This bus stand (next to the railway station and also considered to be the main bus stand) mainly serves buses on the Mumbai route. Most services make a stop at Lonavala. (updated Mar 2016)
18.53185473.8499494 Shivaji Nagar, Rambhau K Kamble Path. This bus stand serves buses for Vidarbha, Konkan, Marathwada and Northern Maharshtra. A few services connect with other cities in the neighboring state of Gujarat. Buses run by Gujarat Roadways run to Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Surat, Kandla and Rajkot. The bus station is outside the Shivaji Nagar Railway station. (updated Mar 2016)
18.49936373.8581275 Swargate ST Stand, Satara Rd. This bus stand serves buses covering the Western Maharashtra and Konkan Region. (updated Mar 2016)
18.4470473.8590336 Katraj. This is not exactly a bus stand but for most of the Interstate buses this acts as a pick up and drop point. (updated Mar 2016)
By taxi[edit]
Shared cabs operate on a route from Pune City Station to Dadar, Mumbai. These taxis seat 4 to 5 people, and charge ₹300 per person using a regular car, ₹800 for a Fiat Premier and ₹1000 for an Ambassador. Cool cabs (taxis with air conditioning) are also available which charge higher. Ali Cool Cab, Just Car, Taxi Guru Solution and arnav cabs provide cabs for doorstep pickup and drop for Pune to Mumbai trips. The rates for such doorstep taxi service start from ₹2100 (including toll-tax). Uber intercity also operates between Mumbai and Pune for about ₹2000.

Get around[edit]



 Fare for taxi and auto-rickshaw 
There is a minimum charge of ₹18 for the first 1.5 km and ₹12.31 for every km after. Fares are rounded to the nearest whole number. The meters now calculate this fare automatically (in the past you had to look up the meter's output on a tariff card, which was itself subject to be counterfeit). Still, there can be additional costs due to large bags or if it is past midnight, but this shouldn't be too much.

  Streets in the centre of Pune
By auto-rickshaws[edit]
There is a massive army of three wheeled rickshaws. Some prepaid rickshaw stands can be found at Shivajinagar, Swargate Bus Depot, and Lohegaon Airport. All rickshaws plying in the Municipal Corporation limits are supposed to charge according to the meter.
Drivers will give you endless excuses why they cannot use the meter. Remember that they are required by law to have a working meter and use it, and this will almost always be cheapest for you too. If they still refuse, walk away: there are plenty of other rickshaws on the roads. In fact, drivers of rickshaws that you flag down from the streets (if practical and possible) will often be more agreeable than those waiting in stands, who demand more fare.
The driver may occasionally stop to ask for directions depending on how familiar he is with the area. Nowadays, many auto rickshaw drivers try to charge extra for long distances or very short distances, or they refuse the fare. Stick to the demand of charging by meter and refuse strongly to pay any extra amount, unless it is past midnight. It is very common for rickshaw drivers plying between 11PM and 6AM to demand 1½ times the normal rates for the journey. You are advised to get this cleared with the driver before boarding the rickshaw.
If they realise you are not from the city, they may try to take longer routes to the destination to charge extra money from you. Thus, outsiders and foreigners, use your own judgement before boarding any auto rickshaw. Autorickshaw drivers may also refuse to travel to quite a few parts of the city as per their convenience; however, this is against the law if their meter reads "on hire" in the upright position. If the sign is turned sideways, the rickshaw driver is not working and can refuse you.
If you have complaints against auto drivers for not accepting short distance rides (or any rides), asking more meter fare, not using a meter, taking other passengers along the way, carrying more passengers than allowed capacity, stopping at bus stands or other similar complaints of serious nature, you can email or call the Road Transport Authorities at 020-22051414 or 020-27492828 (PCMC) or email rtopune@dataone.in. Traffic cops usually come right away to the spot to book a complaint against the driver. Commuters can also send their MMS pictures at +91 9420218338. The complaints should clearly mention all details including the auto's registration number, the time of taking the rickshaw, details of auto fare, the distance commuted, locations, date, time, nature of complaint. After so many calls complaints, the RTO/police can fine them as heavily as ₹50 for refusal of service.

By bus[edit]
City buses in Pune are run by the PMPML. Although the vehicles are crowded and smoke-belching, the network is very extensive. Almost all parts of the city are connected by the PMPML city buses. Major city bus stands include Corporation, Shivaji Nagar, Swargate, Kothrud depot, Nigdi, Hadapsar, Katraj and Deccan. Shivaji Nagar is believed to be the busiest bus stand in the state of Maharashtra. The fare is calculated by distance, and ranges from ₹5 to ₹22. To travel other cities from pune, there are many private bus operators available. You can find from the bus booking sites like Redbus, Abhibus, and Myticketbuddy.

By car[edit]
Though there is a lot of traffic in Pune you can't compare it to Cairo or Kolkata. A majority of the vehicles are two wheelers and apart from the peak hours the roads in Pune are sparsely filled. There are quite a few car rental agencies in Pune. Most of them charge around ₹2500 a day for a mid-size car. There are extra charges for distances above 100 km. It is recommended to get a driver if you are not familiar with Indian cities and this also helps remove the problem of finding parking. Even for India the interpretation of traffic conventions is very flexible and not for the inexperienced or faint hearted. There are also taxis available like Uber, OLA who charge fairly as compared to auto rickshaws.
If you are driving a car always be careful, since motorbike riders may overtake you from left or right and cut lanes without warning.

By two-wheelers[edit]
This city was once known as the city of bicycles, but now it has turned into the city of motorcycles. Most traffic rules are completely ignored in Pune and there are ten times as many two-wheelers as there are cars. The general attitude towards riding motorbikes in the city is that of total ignorance of any set forth traffic regulations along with complete disregard of one's safety (including not wearing a helmet). Here people ride motorbikes as if they are riding a war horse and will generally try to overtake every vehicle in front. Minor accidents on motorbikes are common; You are advised to be careful even when your signal is green as the traffic flow from other direction generally does not stop immediately. Wearing a helmet is compulsory in Pune. The fine for driving without helmets has been increased from ₹100 to ₹500, which includes both the rider as well as the pillion.
Pune's roads might turn to horrid potholes from smooth tarmac in matter of seconds when it rains. Always be on a lookout. The addition of new bicycle tracks all over has made an improvement on two-wheeler traffic.
If you do want to hire a two-wheeler, there are two outfits who rent these vehicles in Pune. A 100cc Bajaj Platina will cost ₹200 a day and an automatic Honda scooter will cost ₹300. If you are planning on day trips from Pune you would be best with the larger wheels and light weight of a motorcycle rather than a scooter. Both outfits will most likely deliver to your accommodation if you ask nicely.

Pune has a full calendar of events, ranging from Classical Music to Rock Concerts. However, Pune's most famous festival is the Pune Festival, which is held during the Ganesha Mahotsav.

The Chatushrungi Fair is an annual event. It is held overnight on Navratri at Senapati Bapat Road. Giant-wheels are the main attractions but the food sold at the stalls is delicious too.
The Ganesh Utsav or Ganeshotsav initiated by Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, today is celebrated with great enthusiasm, as city interiors almost remain blocked for ten days. This is usually around the month of September and dates vary based on Hindu calendar. Pune has more than 2000 mandals with Dagdusheth Halwai being the biggest and most famous one.
The Osho Festival is another international crowd puller in Pune. Held in the Osho Aashram in Koregaon Park, disciples and followers of Bhagwaan Rajneesh make it a point to attend this festival.
The Pune International Film Festival - takes place annually and attracts some splendid films from around the world. This festival which generally takes place in January, lasts for a week and is a treat for film lovers in the city. Passes for single day or for entire duration are available at any of the multiplexes hosting the festival at reasonable rates.
Sawai Gandharva classical music festival, which started back in the 1960s, has had every Indian and international artist perform and has given rise to a number of budding ones too. It is held in the months of December from dawn to dusk over three days.
A number of college festivals have become very commercialised, but still attract big crowds and a very high degree of competition from colleges all over Pune. Verve organised by Express Youth Forum is the biggest inter-collegiate cultural festival in India while Concepts organized by the Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) is a very popular engineering (technical) event. The College of Engineering, Pune also organizes a technical festival which attracts participants from all over India.
So all year round, there is enough excitement to keep Puneites and tourists on their toes!

Itinerary - Hill forts[edit]
A day trip from Pune
Pune - Bhuleshwar - Purandar - Sinhagad - Pune
This round trip takes in some of the interesting hill forts around Pune. Total distance is about 220 km and will take 6 hours just to drive the loop, with lunch and sightseeing added on. The full trip could take up to 12 hours so leave a full day. It is suggested that this trip is undertaken either by motorcycle or 4WD due to the state of some of the roads that are encountered. It is possible to make the journey in a regular car (and many do - even auto ricks) but it will take longer and there will be a heavy toll on the cars suspension. To be as safe as possible you would also want some experience on driving on broken or unsurfaced roads and dealing with the challenges of driving in India.
Leave Pune on the National Highway 9 (Pune Solapur Highway) which passes the racecourse. This is a toll road and also very busy with cars and trucks. If you have taken a motorcycle be very careful.
The turn off to Bhuleshwar is about 35 km from Pune and shortly after the second toll booth (about 2 km before Yavat village). A concrete bridge crosses a canal and the turn off is to the right just before the bridge. There is no sign in English, but there is a sign to Deccan Industrial Explosives pte. After 5 km or so the road will climb into some ghats, where the road becomes quite broken. Once you reach the top of the ghats you will see the temple and a prominent radio mast to the right. The turn to the temple is the next right, the road becomes quite steep at some points.
After visiting the temple and fort (allow 30 to 40 min), return to the road and turn right where you turned off. This road will take you to Saswad (or Sasvad on some maps). There are several turnoffs, keep heading west, but also plenty of people to ask the way, nearly everyone knows Saswad. The scenery is quite flat though enlivened by scenes of Indian rural life. The road is paved but quite rough. You can take lunch when you reach the town.
Thereafter, ask the way for Purandar itself or Nasrapur which is where the road goes. Many people know it. The road is the Diwale to Narayanpur road. In fact the hill itself is easy to spot as it towers above Narayanpur. After 5 km after the turnoff from you will reach a left fork which is signed (not in English). Take this and follow the twisty road to Purandar. As of October 2009, the majority of the road was totally unsurfaced (awaiting surfacing) so would be muddy during rain and there is also the possibility of dealing with the resurfacing activity. Allow 30 minutes to enjoy the views and look at the abandoned army buildings and another 1½ hours to climb to the top and explore.
It will take about 15 minutes to regain the main road if you have a motorbike. Turn left when you reach it and enjoy the smooth tarmac and twists of the road as you pass between the two hills. Eventually you will reach National Highway 4 (also a toll road), turn right and again pay attention to the road hazards.
Approximately 12 km later at Khed take a left turn towards Shivapur. Pass through towards Kondapur, where you take a right fork, thereafter at the T-junction take the left which leads to Sinhagad Fort.
In terms of time to spend here it is best to gauge your stamina and enthusiasm against the amount of light you have left, as it is better to end the journey in daylight rather than drive at night.
Retrace your steps to NH4 and then follow this back to Pune. You will arrive in the Bibvewadi area in the south of the city.

Bhuleshwar-a very beautiful 1100-year-old hill temple near Yavat in the Saswad region. The patterns and beautiful stone statues inside the temple are stunning. This place is around 60 km via Saswad-the closest and most beautiful route. This place and the surrounding areas of Saswad are praised by one British General, the Duke of Welligton as “one of the best peaceful place in the Deccan plateau and the region of beautiful temples”

Camping[edit]

Connect[edit]
Phone[edit]
Pune is well covered by mobile phone networks including Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone Idea & BSNL.
The format of a Pune landline number is +91 20-2xxxxxxx (BSNL) / 3xxxxxxx (Reliance) / 4xxxxxxx (Airtel) / 6xxxxxxx (TATA Indicom)
To call a Mumbai number, the phone does not require STD. Simply dial 022 followed by the 8 digit number.
STD/ISD booths, which are public pay phones are more or less extinct.
Internet[edit]
A large number of internet cafes dot the city. Most private internet cafes charge about ₹10-₹25 an hour.

Stay safe[edit]
Pune is by and large a very safe place. Violent crime is low, although it's important to keep an eye on your belongings in public, as petty theft can occur. Do report any such activity to the police. Keep away from the touts.
Chain-snatching has become the most infamous nuisance. Especially elder women need to be careful. Preventive measure include curbing the desire to wear and flaunt jewellery even in day time.
Locals are by and large friendly and mild mannered, though incidents of mugging have been reported on the outskirts of Pune, especially on highways and desolate stretches. If you face a vehicle breakdown after dark, its best to stay in the vehicle and phone for help.
Although Pune is generally safe for women, it's advisable not to venture out alone into dark and isolated places. Hiring cabs at night without one or more companions is not recommended. Climbing the surrounding hills alone is tempting but unwise-and this goes for both sexes! Having said that, women can confidently walk the streets or visit the shops/pubs/restaurants in the popular residential or commercial areas after sunset.
Driving in Pune is not for the weak-hearted. Like other Indian metros, Pune's vehicle traffic has expanded considerably, and the infrastructure is struggling to keep pace. Lack of discipline especially during overtaking and driving on the wrong side is rampant in the city and on highways. Its common to see rude and impatient drivers at intersections honking away at pedestrians. Enforcement of traffic rules leaves a lot to be desired, unlike Mumbai or other major cities. Road conditions deteriorate especially in heavy traffic areas during monsoon. If you are driving, its a good idea to drive defensively. Be courteous to fellow motorists and maintain lane discipline. Though the helmet rule is not strictly enforced, its always a good idea to wear a helmet while riding a two-wheeler.
