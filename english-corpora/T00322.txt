Kasaragod ([kɑːsɾɡoːɖ] (listen) and Malayalam: Kanhirakode,[1] English: Kassergode, Tulu: Kasrod, Arabic: Harkwillia[9]) is one of the 14 districts in the southern Indian state of Kerala. Its northern border Thalappady is located just 10 km south to Ullal, which is the southernmost portion of the major port city Mangalore, on the southwestern Malabar coast of India.
Kasaragod is the northernmost district of Kerala and is also known as Saptha Bhasha Sangama Bhoomi (The land of seven languages) as seven languages namely, Malayalam, Tulu, Kannada, Marathi, Konkani, Beary, and Urdu are spoken, unlike the other districts of Kerala.[2]
The district is situated on the rich biodiversity of Western Ghats. It was a part of the Kannur district of Kerala until 24 May 1984. The district is bounded by Dakshina Kannada district to the north, Western Ghats to the northeast, Kodagu district to the southeast, Kannur district to the south, and Arabian Sea to the west. Kasaragod district has the maximum number of rivers in Kerala - 12.[10]
Kasaragod town is located on the estuary where the Chandragiri River, which is also the longest river in the district, empties into Arabian Sea. Kasaragod is home to several forts which include Arikady fort, Bekal Fort, Chandragiri Fort, and Hosdurg Fort (Puthiyakotta Fort). Bekal Fort is also the largest fort in Kerala. The historic hill of Ezhimala is located on the southern portion of Kavvayi Backwaters of Nileshwaram.

Etymology
Until 16th century CE, Kasargod town was known by the name Kanhirakode  (meaning, 'The land of Kanhira Trees') in Malayalam.[1] Kasaragod is the Kannada version of Kanhirakode.
Tulunad, where Tulu is traditionally spoken, is said to be bound on the south by the Chandragiri river and fort, thus including Kasaragod city within the Tulunad region.[11] Though linguistically the Tulu country extends to the south only upto the Chandragiri river at present, culturally the region between the Chandragiri and the Kavai (Kavvayi) rivers has remained as a twilight zone between the Malayalam and the Tulu countries.[12]

History
Main article: History of Kasaragod
Ancient period
  Ananthapadmanabhaswamy temple at Ananthapura, Kumbla
The Ancient Tamil Works of Sangam Age records that the area covering 
the district was part of Puzhinadu which consists of the coastal belt from Kozhikode to Mangalore. Politically the area was part of the Ezhimala Kingdom with its Capital at Ezhimala in present day Kannur district. The most famous King of Ezhimala was Nannan whose Kingdom extended up to Gudalur and northern parts of Coimbatore. Poozhinad, along woth Karkanad which included the eastern regions of Ezhimala dynasty (Wayanad-Gudalur region with some portions of Kodagu), had its capital at Ezhimala. The
Mooshaka Kings were considered descendants of Nannan. By the 14th century, Mooshaka Kingdom was known as Kolathirinad and the Rulers as Kolathiris. 
The Kolathunad Kingdom at the peak of its power reportedly extended from 
Netravati River (Mangalore) in the north[13] to Korapuzha (Kozhikode) in the south with Arabian Sea on the 
west and Kodagu hills on the eastern boundary, also including the isolated islands of Lakshadweep in Arabian Sea.[14]

Medieval period

  Arikady fort at Kumbla
Ramacharitam, probably the oldest literary work written in Old Malayalam, which dates back to 12th century CE, is thought to have written in Kasargod district as its manuscripts were discovered from Nileshwaram and the poem mentions about Ananthapura Lake Temple in Kumbla in detail.[15] Kasaragod was known to the Arabs by the name Harkwillia.[9] Malik Dinar Mosque at Kasaragod town is one of the oldest mosques in Indian Subcontinent. According to Qissat Shakarwati Farmad, the Masjids at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Dharmadam, Panthalayini, and Chaliyam, were built during the era of Malik Dinar, and they are among the oldest Masjids in Indian Subcontinent.[16] It is believed that Malik Dinar was died at Thalangara in Kasaragod town.[17]
Many Arab travelers visiting Kerala between the 9th and the 14th centuries visited Kasaragod, being an important trade centre then. Duarte Borbosa, a Portuguese traveler who visited Kumbla, near Kasargod in 1514  recorded that rice being exported for coir to Maldives.[9] According to Barbosa, the people in the southwestern Malabar coast of India from Kasaragod in the north to Kanyakumari in the south had spoke a unique language, which they called as "Maliama" (Malayalam).[18]
Until 16th century CE, Kasargod town was known by the name Kanhirakode (may be by the meaning, 'The land of Kanhira Trees') in Malayalam.[1] The Kumbla dynasty, who swayed over the land of southern Tulu Nadu wedged between Chandragiri River and Netravati River (including present-day Taluks of Manjeshwar and Kasaragod) from Maipady Palace at Kumbla, had also been vassals to  the Kolathunadu kingdom of North Malabar, before the Carnatic conquests of Vijayanagara Empire.[19] The Kumbla dynasty had a mixed lineage of Malayali Nairs and Tuluva Brahmins.[20] They also claimed their origin from Cheraman Perumals of Kerala.[20] Francis Buchanan-Hamilton states that the customs of Kumbla dynasty were similar to those of the contemporary Malayali kings.[20]
The  Kolathiri  Dominion  emerged  into  independent 10 principalities i.e., Kadathanadu (Vadakara), Randathara or Poyanad (Dharmadom), Kottayam (Thalassery), Nileshwaram, Iruvazhinadu (Panoor), Kurumbranad etc.,   under   separate   royal   chieftains   due   to   the   outcome   of   internal dissensions.[21] Many portions of the present-day Hosdurg taluk (Kanhangad) and Vellarikundu were parts of the Nileshwaram dynasty, who were relatives to both Kolathunadu as well as Zamorin of Calicut, in the early medieval period.[22] The areas north to the Chandragiri river (present-day Taluks of Manjeshwaram and Kasaragod) were ruled by the Kumbala dynasty. According to local legends, the region between Talapadi and Kavvayi rivers which constituted the erstwhile Kasaragod taluk, consisted of 32 Tulu and 32 Malayalam villages.[20]
Kannada kingdoms focused on Kasaragod in the 16th century CE. The Vijayanagara empire attacked and annexed Kasaragod from the Kolathiri Raja with Nileshwaram as one of the capital in the 16th century. During the decline of the Vijayanagara empire, the administration of this area was vested with Ikkeri Nayakas.[9] At the onset of collapse of the Vijayanagara empire, Venkappa Nayaka declared independence to Ikkery. Kumbla, Chandragiri, and Bekal are considered to be the chain of forts constructed or renovated by Shivappa Nayaka.[9]
The Chandragiri Fort is built on the southern bank of the estuary of Chandragiri River, just opposite to Kasaragod town.  The Bekal Fort at Bekal, Pallikkara, which is situated in the midway between Kasaragod and Kanhangad, and is also largest fort in Kerala, was built in 1650 by Shivappa Nayaka of Keladi.[23]

Francis Buchanan, the family doctor of Arthur Wellesley, visited Kasaragod in 1800.[9] In his travelogue, he recorded information on places like Athiraparambu, Kavvai, Nileshwaram, Bekal, Chandragiri and Manjeshwar.[9] Hosdurg and Vellarikundu is part of Kolathunadu  (south of Chandragiri river) and Kasargod and Manjeshwaram is in the Tulu Nadu region (north of Chandragiri river). On 19th January, 1801, Francis speaks of visiting a Siva temple at Pulla (Pallikere), beyond which, the country rises into open rising lands, all the way to Chandragiri river and Chandragiri fort, which he describes as the northern border of the Malayala. He says that the country on the north of the Chandragiri fort and river is called by Hindus as Tuluva, the Tulu country.[24]  According to Stuart (1895), the Kasaragod taluk originally formed the southern portion of the ancient Tuluva kingdom and was separated from the kingdom of Kerala by the Chandragiri river; the river on which the fort stands is shallow but very wide and formed the southern boundary of the ancient Tuluva kingdom. The Nayars and the other females of the Kasaragod taluk of South Canara, were prohibited from crossing the river.[25] In 1763, Hyder Ali raided Bedanoor (Bidnur), the capital of the Ikkery Naiks. His son Tippu Sultan raided much of Malabar region in Kerala. As per the Treaty of Seringapatam of 1792, Tippu surrendered Malabar, except Kanara to the British. The British occupied Kanara only after the death of Tippu Sultan.[9] it is said that Kinavoor Molom (Sree Dharma Shashtha Temple) is belonging to Karinthalam (one of 64 Brahmin villages in old Kerala).
Before the formation of Kerala, Kasargod was a part of South Canara district of erstwhile Madras Presidency. Initially South Canara was included in the Bombay presidency.[26] Later on 16 April 1862, South Canara was transferred to Madras Presidency and Kasaragod taluk was formed by replacing the erstwhile Bekal taluk.[26] However, in 19th century CE, Kasargod Taluk witnessed many struggles to separate the region from South Canara and to merge it with the Malabar District as it was the only Malayalam-majority region in South Canara. Kasaragod was the second-most populated Taluk in South Canara only after to Mangalore taluk, and also the second-largest Taluk.[27] Kasargod became a part of Kannur district of Kerala following the reorganization of states and the formation of Kerala on 1 November 1956.[28] Later Kasargod was divided into two Taluks for the ease of administration - Kasargod and Hosdurg. Kasargod was declared a district in the year 1984. The inclusion of Kasaragod with Kerala has been a contentious issue as there is a sizeable population that speaks Tulu and Kannada. At the time of 1951 Census of India, only 72.0% of the district's population chose their mother tongue as Malayalam.[29] 14.2% chose Tulu and 6.3% chose Kannada.[29] But it is noted that as per the 2011 census report only 8.8% and 4.2% of the total population in the district speak Tulu and Kannada respectively as their mother tongue. In 2012, the Second Oommen Chandy ministry appointed a commission under the leadership the former Chief Secretary P. Prabhakaran to study about the backwardness and issues faced by this northernmost district of Kerala and to draw up special package for the district.[30] In 2013, two more Taluks, namely Manjeshwaram and Vellarikundu were formed in the district.[31]

In 2012, the Second Oommen Chandy ministry appointed a commission under the leadership of the former Chief Secretary P. Prabhakaran to study about the backwardness and issues faced by this northernmost district of Kerala and to draw up a special package for the district.[30] In 2013, two more Taluks, namely Manjeshwaram and Vellarikundu were formed in the district.[31] Before it the district had only two Taluks. The decision to implement a gas-based powerplant at Cheemeni was took by the Second Chandy government.[59] A government medical college was allowed for Kasaragod district, as a part of the government's new policy to establish at ensure availability of at least one Government Medical College in all the 14 districts of state in the year 2013.[60][61]
