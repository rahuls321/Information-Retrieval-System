SECTION LXXXI
"Sahadeva said, 'What hath been said by the king is, indeed, eternal
virtue, but thou, O chastiser of foes, shouldst act, in such a way that
war may certainly happen. Even if the Kauravas express their desire for
peace with the Pandavas, still, O thou of Dasarha's race, provoke thou a
war with them. Having seen, O Krishna, the princess of Panchala brought
in that plight into the midst of the assembly, how can my wrath be
appeased without the slaughter of Suyodhana. If, O Krishna, Bhima and
Arjuna and king Yudhishthira the just are disposed to be virtuous,
abandoning virtue I desire an encounter with Duryodhana in battle.'
"Satyaki said, 'The high-souled Sahadeva, O thou of mighty arms, hath
spoken the truth. The rage I feel towards Duryodhana can be appeased only
by his death. Dost thou not remember the rage thou too hadst felt upon
beholding in the woods the distressed Pandavas clad in rags and
deer-skins? Therefore, O foremost of men, all the warriors assembled here
unanimously subscribe to what the heroic son of Madri, fierce in battle,
hath said!'
"Vaisampayana continued, 'At these words of the high-souled Yuyudhana, a
leonine roar was set up by all the warriors assembled there. And all the
heroes, highly applauding those words of Satyaki, praised him, saying,
'Excellent! Excellent!' And anxious to fight, they all began to express
their joy.'"
