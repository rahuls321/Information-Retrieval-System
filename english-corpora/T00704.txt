Kaziranga National park is in Assam, India and is famous as the home of the rhinoceros. As the region's principal tourist attraction, the park draws over 170,000 visitors every year. It has been very effective in protecting species at risk such as the Indian one-horned rhinoceros (of the 3600 left worldwide, 2400 are in Kaziranga park).


Understand[edit]Kaziranga is one of the oldest national parks in India and is the largest habitat for Indian single-horned rhino (rhinoceros unicornis). Kaziranga is also a  UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Its success in conservation has had a price. Forest guards, heavily armed and largely immune to prosecution, killed 50 people from 2013-2015. There are no fences or signs marking the edge of the park; alleged poachers and anyone wandering within the park at night risks being shot on sight or with very little warning. Local villagers and tribal peoples have often been maimed or killed. Many villagers have been dispossessed of homes and land to allow park expansion.
History[edit]Kaziranga National Park was said to be first recognised around 1940, but was established in 1974. It has been substantially expanded over the years, resulting in neighbouring villages being demolished for land reclamation, leading to controversy.
The park was devastated by the July 2019 flooding, which had killed over 140 large mammals, which included at least 12 rhinos.
Landscape[edit]Flora and fauna[edit]  A one horned rhino at Kaziranga National ParkKaziranga hosts a rich and diverse population of almost 42 species of fish, 9 species of amphibians, 27 species of reptiles, more than 491 species of birds and 35 species of mammals. Among the larger mammals, there are almost 86 tigers (2000 census), 1048 elephants (2002 census), 2048 rhinos (2009 census), 1431 buffalo (2001 census) and 486 swamp deer. Kaziranga also houses more than 546 species of flora. Kaziranga is said to have about 86 tigers, which is the highest density of tigers in the world (1 every 5 km², 2000 census)
Visitors seldom see tigers due to the dense, tall grass. The rhinoceros is the real star of the park. Kaziranga also has one of the very last populations of truly wild Asian water buffalo, but even here there are many feral descendants of domesticated water buffalo, and hybridization occurs.  The park is also the last haven for greater adjutant storks, with fewer than one hundred nesting pairs.
Climate[edit]The climate is typically tropical. It varies from very hot and humid in the summer (April to June) to cold nights and warm days in  thewinter (from November to January). Kaziranga gets flooded by the water of the Brahmaputra River almost every year during the monsoon. The rainy season prevails from June to August. When it rains, Kaziranga becomes inaccessible. The best time to visit Kaziranga is in September - October or February/March.

If visiting Kaziranga after a trip to Arunachal Pradesh, Tezpur is the best destination from which to catch a bus here. If entering the state of Assam via Guwahati, take a bus from there to Kaziranga National Park. Bus fare varies between private service and Government service.

Tours are operated by various adventure tourism firms.

  Map of Kaziranga National Park


See[edit][add listing]  Hog deer at KazirangaWatch wildlife either from on top of an elephant or from a Jeep. All of the plain lands are infested by tall elephant grass, so it is more convenient to watch wildlife from an elephant's back. Rhinos, wild buffalo, hog deer, etc can be easily seen from an elephant back's view. Most of the animals are habituated with human presence and don't feel shy. Carrying a good pair of binoculars is a must whether watching from a Jeep or while riding an elephant.



Do[edit][add listing]Stay at one of the local lodges, such as Nature hunt Eco Camp, Wild Grass Resort or Diphlu River Lodge. A evening of music and great food rounds off the day so nicely.
Take an elephant ride into the grassland for up-close encounters with the famous one-horned rhinocerous.  Elephant rides take place very early in the morning and last about an hour.
Take a jeep tour of the park to see other wildlife such as storks, fish-eagles, and barasingha (swamp deer).

Drink[edit][add listing]There are several wine shops at Kohora though the liquor is not cheap. Getting chilled bottles is not possible every time because there are acute power shortages in the area.

Stay safe[edit]Hiking in Kaziranga is prohibited to stop man-animal conflicts, so going on a jeep or elephant-back tour are the only options.  There is malaria in the region, but night-flying mosquitos are not active during the winter months which are the ideal time for visiting.  Most local cases of malaria occur in the summer, when the park is closed.


Go next[edit]If you head to Kohora across from the main entrance to Kaziranga, you can reserve a bus there or just wait for a bus heading to your location as it passes by. Buses pass frequently.
Hills of Karby Anglong district is a nice place for an outing.
Drive down to Sibsagar, in Upper Assam, to visit the famed "Rong Ghor", an amphitheatre built by Ahom kings for their entertainment.
