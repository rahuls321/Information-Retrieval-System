The Artin reciprocity law,  which was established by Emil Artin in a series of papers (1924; 1927; 1930), is a general theorem in number theory that forms a central part of global class field theory. The term "reciprocity law" refers to a long line of more concrete number theoretic statements which it generalized, from the quadratic reciprocity law and the reciprocity laws of Eisenstein and Kummer to Hilbert's product formula for the norm symbol. Artin's result provided a partial solution to Hilbert's ninth problem. Statement Let L⁄K be a Galois extension of global fields and CL stand for the idèle class group of L. One of the statements of the Artin reciprocity law is that there is a canonical isomorphism called the global symbol map                     θ        :                  C                      K                                    /                                      N                          L                              /                            K                                (                      C                          L                                )                →        Gal        ⁡        (        L                  /                K                  )                      ab                          ,              {\displaystyle \theta :C_{K}/{N_{L/K}(C_{L})}\to \operatorname {Gal} (L/K)^{\text{ab}},}  where ab denotes the abelianization of a group. The map                     θ              {\displaystyle \theta }   is defined by assembling the maps called the local Artin symbol, the local reciprocity map or the norm residue symbol                              θ                      v                          :                  K                      v                                ×                                    /                          N                                    L                              v                                                    /                                      K                              v                                                    (                  L                      v                                ×                          )        →                  G                      ab                          ,              {\displaystyle \theta _{v}:K_{v}^{\times }/N_{L_{v}/K_{v}}(L_{v}^{\times })\to G^{\text{ab}},}  for different places v of K. More precisely,                     θ              {\displaystyle \theta }   is given by the local maps                               θ                      v                                {\displaystyle \theta _{v}}   on the v-component of an idèle class. The maps                               θ                      v                                {\displaystyle \theta _{v}}   are isomorphisms. This is the content of the local reciprocity law, a main theorem of local class field theory.= Proof =A cohomological proof of the global reciprocity law can be achieved by first establishing that                    (        Gal        ⁡        (                  K                      s            e            p                                    /                K        )        ,                              lim            →                          ⁡                  C                      L                          )              {\displaystyle (\operatorname {Gal} (K^{sep}/K),\varinjlim C_{L})}  constitutes a class formation in the sense of Artin and Tate. Then one proves that                                                                        H                ^                                                          0                          (        Gal        ⁡        (        L                  /                K        )        ,                  C                      L                          )        ≃                                                            H                ^                                                          −            2                          (        Gal        ⁡        (        L                  /                K        )        ,                  Z                )        ,              {\displaystyle {\hat {H}}^{0}(\operatorname {Gal} (L/K),C_{L})\simeq {\hat {H}}^{-2}(\operatorname {Gal} (L/K),\mathbb {Z} ),}  where                                                                         H                ^                                                          i                                {\displaystyle {\hat {H}}^{i}}   denote the Tate cohomology groups. Working out the cohomology groups establishes that θ is an isomorphism. Significance Artin's reciprocity law implies a description of the abelianization of the absolute Galois group of a global field K which is based on the Hasse local–global principle and the use of the Frobenius elements. Together with the Takagi existence theorem, it is used to describe the abelian extensions of K in terms of the arithmetic of K and to understand the behavior of the nonarchimedean places in them. Therefore, the Artin reciprocity law can be interpreted as one of the main theorems of global class field theory. It can be used to prove that Artin L-functions are meromorphic and for the proof of the Chebotarev density theorem.Two years after the publication of his general reciprocity law in 1927, Artin rediscovered the transfer homomorphism of I. Schur and used the reciprocity law to translate the principalization problem for ideal classes of algebraic number fields into the group theoretic task of determining the kernels of transfers of finite non-abelian groups. Finite extensions of global fields The definition of the Artin map for a finite abelian extension L/K of global fields (such as a finite abelian extension of                               Q                      {\displaystyle \mathbb {Q} }  ) has a concrete description in terms of prime ideals and Frobenius elements.If                                           p                                {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {p}}}   is a prime of K then the decomposition groups of primes                                           P                                {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {P}}}   above                                           p                                {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {p}}}   are equal in Gal(L/K) since the latter group is abelian.

Statement in terms of L-functions An alternative version of the reciprocity law, leading to the Langlands program, connects Artin L-functions associated to abelian extensions of a number field with Hecke L-functions associated to characters of the idèle class group.A Hecke character (or Größencharakter) of a number field K is defined to be a quasicharacter of the idèle class group of K. Robert Langlands interpreted Hecke characters as automorphic forms on the reductive algebraic group GL(1) over the ring of adeles of K.Let                     E                  /                K              {\displaystyle E/K}   be an abelian Galois extension with Galois group G. Then for any character                     σ        :        G        →                              C                                ×                                {\displaystyle \sigma :G\to \mathbb {C} ^{\times }}   (i.e. one-dimensional complex representation of the group G), there exists a Hecke character                     χ              {\displaystyle \chi }   of K such that                              L                      E                          /                        K                                              A              r              t              i              n                                      (        σ        ,        s        )        =                  L                      K                                              H              e              c              k              e                                      (        χ        ,        s        )              {\displaystyle L_{E/K}^{\mathrm {Artin} }(\sigma ,s)=L_{K}^{\mathrm {Hecke} }(\chi ,s)}  where the left hand side is the Artin L-function associated to the extension with character σ and the right hand side is the Hecke L-function associated with χ, Section 7.D of.The formulation of the Artin reciprocity law as an equality of L-functions allows formulation of a generalisation to n-dimensional representations, though a direct correspondence is still lacking.
