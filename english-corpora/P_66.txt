SECTION LXVI
(Sambhava Parva continued)
"Vaisampayana said, 'It is known that the spiritual sons of Brahman were
the six great Rishis (already mentioned). There was another of the name
of Sthanu. And the sons of Sthanu, gifted with great energy, were, it is
known, eleven. They were Mrigavayadha, Sarpa, Niriti of great fame:
Ajaikapat, Ahivradhna, and Pinaki, the oppressor of foes; Dahana and
Iswara, and Kapali of great splendour; and Sthanu, and the illustrious
Bharga. These are called the eleven Rudras. It hath been already said,
that Marichi, Angiras. Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu--these six great
Rishis of great energy--are the sons of Brahman. It is well-known in the
world that Angiras's sons are three,--Vrihaspati, Utathya, and Samvarta,
all of rigid vows. And, O king, it is said that the sons of Atri are
numerous. And, being great Rishis, they are all conversant with the
Vedas, crowned with ascetic success, and of souls in perfect peace. And,
O tiger among kings, the sons of Pulastya of great wisdom are Rakshasas,
Monkeys, Kinnaras (half-men and half-horses), and Yakshas. And, O king,
the son of Pulaha were, it is said, the Salabhas (the winged insects),
the lions, the Kimpurushas (half-lions and half-men), the tigers, bears,
and wolves. And the sons of Kratu, sacred as sacrifices, are the
companions of Surya, (the Valikhilyas), known in three worlds and devoted
to truth and vows. And, O protector of the Earth, the illustrious Rishi
Daksha, of soul in complete peace, and of great asceticism, sprung from
the right toe of Brahman. And from the left toe of Brahman sprang the
wife of the high-souled Daksha. And the Muni begat upon her fifty
daughters; and all those daughters were of faultless features and limbs
and of eyes like lotus-petals. And the lord Daksha, not having any sons,
made those daughters his Putrikas (so that their sons might belong both
to himself and to their husbands). And Daksha bestowed, according to the
sacred ordinance, ten of his daughters on Dharma, twenty-seven on Chandra
(the Moon), and thirteen on Kasyapa. Listen as I recount the wives of
Dharma according to their names. They are ten in all--Kirti, Lakshmi,
Dhriti, Medha, Pushti, Sraddha, Kria, Buddhi, Lajja, and Mali. These are
the wives of Dharma as appointed by the Self-create. It is known also
throughout the world that the wives of Soma (Moon) are twenty-seven. And
the wives of Soma, all of sacred vows, are employed in indicating time;
and they are the Nakshatras and the Yoginis and they became so for
assisting the courses of the worlds.
"And Brahman had another son named Manu. And Manu had a son of the name
of Prajapati. And the sons of Prajapati were eight and were called Vasus
whom I shall name in detail. They were Dhara, Dhruva, Soma, Aha, Anila,
Anala, Pratyusha, and Prabhasa. These eight are known as the Vasus. Of
these, Dhara and the truth-knowing Dhruva were born of Dhumra; Chandramas
(Soma) and Swasana (Anila) were born of the intelligent Swasa; Aha was
the son of Rata: and Hutasana (Anala) of Sandilya; and Pratyusha and
Prabhasa were the sons of Prabhata. And Dhara had two sons, Dravina and
Huta-havya-vaha. And the son of Dhruva is the illustrious Kala (Time),
the destroyer of the worlds. And Soma's son is the resplendent Varchas.
And Varchas begot upon his wife Manohara three sons--Sisira, and Ramana.
And the son of Aha were Jyotih, Sama, Santa, and also Muni. And the son
of Agni is the handsome Kumara born in a forest of reeds. And, he is also
called Kartikeya because he was reared by Krittika and others. And, after
Kartikeya, there were born his three brothers Sakha, Visakha, Naigameya.
And the wife of Anila is Siva, and Siva's son were Manojava and
Avijnataagati. These two were the sons of Anila. The son of Pratyusha,
you must know, is the Rishi named Devala; and Devala had two sons who
were both exceedingly forgiving and of great mental power. And the sister
of Vrihaspati, the first of women, uttering the sacred truth, engaged in
ascetic penances, roamed over the whole earth; and she became the wife of
Prabhasa, the eighth Vasu. And she brought forth the illustrious
Viswakarman, the founder of all arts. And he was the originator of a
thousand arts, the engineer of the immortals, the maker of all kinds of
ornaments, and the first of artists. And he it was who constructed the
celestial cars of the gods, and mankind are enabled to live in
consequence of the inventions of that illustrious one. And he is
worshipped, for that reason, by men. And he is eternal and immutable,
this Viswakarman.
"And the illustrious Dharma, the dispenser of all happiness, assuming a
human countenance, came out through the right breast of Brahman. And
Ahasta (Dharma) hath three excellent sons capable of charming every
creature. And they are Sama, Kama, Harsha (Peace, Desire, and Joy). And
by their energy they are supporting the worlds. And the wife of Kama is
Rati, of Sama is Prapti; and the wife of Harsha is Nanda. And upon them,
indeed, are the worlds made to depend.
"And the son of Marichi is Kasyapa. And Kasyapa's offspring are the gods
and the Asuras. And, therefore, is Kasyapa, the Father of the worlds. And
Tvashtri, of the form of Vadava (a mare), became the wife of Savitri. And
she gave birth, in the skies, to two greatly fortunate twins, the Aswins.
And, O king, the sons of Aditi are twelve with Indra heading them all.
And the youngest of them all was Vishnu upon whom the worlds depend.
"These are the thirty-three gods (the eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the
twelve Adityas, Prajapati, and Vashatkara). I shall now recount their
progeny according to their Pakshas, Kulas, and Ganas. The Rudras, the
Saddhyas, the Maruts, the Vasus, the Bhargavas, and the Viswedevas are
each reckoned as a Paksha. Garuda the son of Vinata and the mighty Aruna
also, and the illustrious Vrihaspati are reckoned among the Adityas. The
twin Aswins, all annual plants, and all inferior animals, are reckoned
among the Guhyakas.
"These are the Ganas of the gods recited to thee, O king! This recitation
washes men of all sins.
"The illustrious Bhrigu came out, ripping open the breast of Brahman. The
learned Sukra is Bhrigu's son. And the learned Sukra becoming a planet
and engaged according to the command of the Self-existent in pouring and
withholding rain, and in dispensing and remitting calamities, traverses,
for sustaining the lives of all the creatures in the three worlds,
through the skies. And the learned Sukra, of great intelligence and
wisdom, of rigid vows, leading the life of a Brahmacharin, divided
himself in twain by power of asceticism, and became the spiritual guide
of both the Daityas and the gods. And after Sukra was thus employed by
Brahman in seeking the welfare (of the gods and the Asuras), Bhrigu begot
another excellent son. This was Chyavana who was like the blazing sun, of
virtuous soul, and of great fame. And he came out of his mother's womb in
anger and became the cause of his mother's release, O king (from the
hands of the Rakshasas). And Arushi, the daughter of Manu, became the
wife of the wise Chyavana. And, on her was begotten Aurva of great
reputation. And he came out, ripping open the thigh of Arushi. And Aurva
begot Richika. And Richika even in his boyhood became possessed of great
power and energy, and of every virtue. And Richika begot Jamadagni. And
the high-souled Jamadagni had four sons. And the youngest of them all was
Rama (Parasurama). And Rama was superior to all his brothers in the
possession of good qualities. And he was skilful in all weapons, and
became the slayer of the Kshatriyas. And he had his passions under
complete control. And Aurva had a hundred sons with Jamadagni the eldest.
And these hundred sons had offspring by thousands spread over this earth.
"And Brahman had two other sons, viz., Dhatri and Vidhatri who stayed
with Manu. Their sister is the auspicious Lakshmi having her abode amid
lotuses. And the spiritual sons of Lakshmi are the sky-ranging horses.
And the daughter born of Sukra, named Divi, became the eldest wife of
Varuna. Of her were born a son named Vala and a daughter named Sura
(wine), to the joy of the gods. And Adharma (Sin) was born when creatures
(from want of food) began to devour one another. And Adharma always
destroys every creature. And Adharma hath Niriti for his wife, whence the
Rakshasas who are called Nairitas (offspring of Niriti). And she hath
also three other cruel sons always engaged in sinful deeds. They are
Bhaya (fear), Mahabhaya (terror), and Mrityu (Death) who is always
engaged in slaying every created thing. And, as he is all-destroying, he
hath no wife, and no son. And Tamra brought forth five daughters known
throughout the worlds. They are Kaki (crow), Syeni (hawk), Phasi (hen),
Dhritarashtri (goose), and Suki (parrot). And Kaki brought forth the
crows; Syeni, the hawks, the cocks and vultures, Dhritarashtri, all ducks
and swans; and she also brought forth all Chakravakas; and the fair Suki,
of amiable qualities, and possessing all auspicious signs brought forth
all the parrots. And Krodha gave birth to nine daughters, all of wrathful
disposition. And their names were Mrigi, Mrigamanda, Hari, Bhadramana,
Matangi, Sarduli, Sweta, Surabhi, and the agreeable Surasa blessed with
every virtue. And, O foremost of men, the offspring of Mrigi are all
animals of the deer species. And the offspring of Mrigamanda are all
animals of the bear species and those called Srimara (sweet-footed). And
Bhadramana begot the celestial elephants, Airavata. And the offspring of
Hari are all animals of the simian species endued with great activity, so
also all the horses. And those animals also, that are called Go-langula
(the cow-tailed), are said to be the offspring of Hari. And Sarduli begot
lions and tigers in numbers, and also leopards and all other strong
animals. And, O king, the offspring of Matangi are all the elephants. And
Sweta begat the large elephant known by the name of Sweta, endued with
great speed. And, O king, Surabhi gave birth to two daughters, the
amiable Rohini and the far-famed Gandharvi. And, O Bharata, she had also
two other daughters named Vimala and Anala. From Rohini have sprung all
kine, and from Gandharvi all animals of the horse species. And Anala
begat the seven kinds of trees yielding pulpy fruits. (They are the date,
the palm, the hintala, the tali, the little date, the nut, and the
cocoanut.) And she had also another daughter called Suki (the mother of
the parrot species). And Surasa bore a son called Kanka (a species of
long-feathered birds). And Syeni, the wife of Aruna, gave birth to two
sons of great energy and strength, named Sampati and the mighty Jatayu.
Surasa also bore the Nagas, and Kadru, the Punnagas (snakes). And Vinata
had two sons Garuda and Aruna, known far and wide. And, O king of men, O
foremost of intelligent persons, thus hath the genealogy of all the
principal creatures been fully described by me. By listening to this, a
man is fully cleansed of all his sins, and acquireth great knowledge, and
finally attaineth to the first of states in after-life!'"
