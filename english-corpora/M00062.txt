In mathematics, geometric calculus extends the geometric algebra to include differentiation and integration.  The formalism is powerful and can be shown to encompass other mathematical theories including differential geometry and differential forms. Differentiation With a geometric algebra given, let                     a              {\displaystyle a}   and                     b              {\displaystyle b}   be vectors and let                     F              {\displaystyle F}   be a multivector-valued function of a vector.  The directional derivative of                     F              {\displaystyle F}   along                     b              {\displaystyle b}   at                     a              {\displaystyle a}   is defined as                    (                  ∇                      b                          F        )        (        a        )        =                  lim                      ϵ            →            0                                                              F              (              a              +              ϵ              b              )              −              F              (              a              )                        ϵ                          ,              {\displaystyle (\nabla _{b}F)(a)=\lim _{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}{\frac {F(a+\epsilon b)-F(a)}{\epsilon }},}  provided that the limit exists for all                     b              {\displaystyle b}  , where the limit is taken for scalar                     ϵ              {\displaystyle \epsilon }  .  This is similar to the usual definition of a directional derivative but extends it to functions that are not necessarily scalar-valued.Next, choose a set of basis vectors                     {                  e                      i                          }              {\displaystyle \{e_{i}\}}   and consider the operators, denoted                               ∂                      i                                {\displaystyle \partial _{i}}  , that perform directional derivatives in the directions of                               e                      i                                {\displaystyle e_{i}}  :                              ∂                      i                          :        F        ↦        (        x        ↦        (                  ∇                                    e                              i                                                    F        )        (        x        )        )        .              {\displaystyle \partial _{i}:F\mapsto (x\mapsto (\nabla _{e_{i}}F)(x)).}  Then, using the Einstein summation notation, consider the operator:                              e                      i                                    ∂                      i                          ,              {\displaystyle e^{i}\partial _{i},}  which means                    F        ↦                  e                      i                                    ∂                      i                          F        ,              {\displaystyle F\mapsto e^{i}\partial _{i}F,}  where the geometric product is applied after the directional derivative.  More verbosely:                    F        ↦        (        x        ↦                  e                      i                          (                  ∇                                    e                              i                                                    F        )        (        x        )        )        .              {\displaystyle F\mapsto (x\mapsto e^{i}(\nabla _{e_{i}}F)(x)).}  This operator is independent of the choice of frame, and can thus be used to define the geometric derivative:                    ∇        =                  e                      i                                    ∂                      i                          .              {\displaystyle \nabla =e^{i}\partial _{i}.}  This is similar to the usual definition of the gradient, but it, too, extends to functions that are not necessarily scalar-valued.The directional derivative is linear regarding its direction, that is:                              ∇                      α            a            +            β            b                          =        α                  ∇                      a                          +        β                  ∇                      b                          .              {\displaystyle \nabla _{\alpha a+\beta b}=\alpha \nabla _{a}+\beta \nabla _{b}.}  From this follows that the directional derivative is the inner product of its direction by the geometric derivative.  All needs to be observed is that the direction                     a              {\displaystyle a}   can be written                     a        =        (        a        ⋅                  e                      i                          )                  e                      i                                {\displaystyle a=(a\cdot e^{i})e_{i}}  , so that:                              ∇                      a                          =                  ∇                      (            a            ⋅                          e                              i                                      )                          e                              i                                                    =        (        a        ⋅                  e                      i                          )                  ∇                                    e                              i                                                    =        a        ⋅        (                  e                      i                                    ∇                                    e                              i                                                    )        =        a        ⋅        ∇        .              {\displaystyle \nabla _{a}=\nabla _{(a\cdot e^{i})e_{i}}=(a\cdot e^{i})\nabla _{e_{i}}=a\cdot (e^{i}\nabla _{e_{i}})=a\cdot \nabla .}  For this reason,                               ∇                      a                          F        (        x        )              {\displaystyle \nabla _{a}F(x)}   is often noted                     a        ⋅        ∇        F        (        x        )              {\displaystyle a\cdot \nabla F(x)}  .The standard order of operations for the geometric derivative is that it acts only on the function closest to its immediate right.  Given two functions                     F              {\displaystyle F}   and                     G              {\displaystyle G}  , then for example we have                    ∇        F        G        =        (        ∇        F        )        G        .              {\displaystyle \nabla FG=(\nabla F)G.}  = Product rule =Although the partial derivative exhibits a product rule, the geometric derivative only partially inherits this property.

A solution is to adopt the overdot notation, in which the scope of a geometric derivative with an overdot is the multivector-valued function sharing the same overdot.  In this case, if we define                                                        ∇              ˙                                      F                                            G              ˙                                      =                  e                      i                          F        (                  ∂                      i                          G        )        ,              {\displaystyle {\dot {\nabla }}F{\dot {G}}=e^{i}F(\partial _{i}G),}  then the product rule for the geometric derivative is                    ∇        (        F        G        )        =        ∇        F        G        +                                            ∇              ˙                                      F                                            G              ˙                                      .              {\displaystyle \nabla (FG)=\nabla FG+{\dot {\nabla }}F{\dot {G}}.}  = Interior and exterior derivative =Let                     F              {\displaystyle F}   be an                     r              {\displaystyle r}  -grade multivector.  Then we can define an additional pair of operators, the interior and exterior derivatives,                    ∇        ⋅        F        =        ⟨        ∇        F                  ⟩                      r            −            1                          =                  e                      i                          ⋅                  ∂                      i                          F        ,              {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot F=\langle \nabla F\rangle _{r-1}=e^{i}\cdot \partial _{i}F,}                      ∇        ∧        F        =        ⟨        ∇        F                  ⟩                      r            +            1                          =                  e                      i                          ∧                  ∂                      i                          F        .              {\displaystyle \nabla \wedge F=\langle \nabla F\rangle _{r+1}=e^{i}\wedge \partial _{i}F.}  In particular, if                     F              {\displaystyle F}   is grade 1 (vector-valued function), then we can write                    ∇        F        =        ∇        ⋅        F        +        ∇        ∧        F              {\displaystyle \nabla F=\nabla \cdot F+\nabla \wedge F}  and identify the divergence and curl as                    ∇        ⋅        F        =        div        ⁡        F        ,              {\displaystyle \nabla \cdot F=\operatorname {div} F,}                      ∇        ∧        F        =        I                curl        ⁡        F        .              {\displaystyle \nabla \wedge F=I\,\operatorname {curl} F.}  Unlike the geometric derivative, neither the interior derivative operator nor the exterior derivative operator is invertible. Integration Let                     {                  e                      1                          ,        …        ,                  e                      n                          }              {\displaystyle \{e_{1},\ldots ,e_{n}\}}   be a set of basis vectors that span an                     n              {\displaystyle n}  -dimensional vector space.  From geometric algebra, we interpret the pseudoscalar                               e                      1                          ∧                  e                      2                          ∧        ⋯        ∧                  e                      n                                {\displaystyle e_{1}\wedge e_{2}\wedge \cdots \wedge e_{n}}   to be the signed volume of the                     n              {\displaystyle n}  -parallelotope subtended by these basis vectors.  If the basis vectors are orthonormal, then this is the unit pseudoscalar.More generally, we may restrict ourselves to a subset of                     k              {\displaystyle k}   of the basis vectors, where                     1        ≤        k        ≤        n              {\displaystyle 1\leq k\leq n}  , to treat the length, area, or other general                     k              {\displaystyle k}  -volume of a subspace in the overall                     n              {\displaystyle n}  -dimensional vector space.  We denote these selected basis vectors by                     {                  e                                    i                              1                                                    ,        …        ,                  e                                    i                              k                                                    }              {\displaystyle \{e_{i_{1}},\ldots ,e_{i_{k}}\}}  .

We may divide this volume into a sum of simplices.  Let                     {                  x                      i                          }              {\displaystyle \{x_{i}\}}   be the coordinates of the vertices.

This blade defines a projection of vectors onto the manifold:                                                        P                                            B                          (        A        )        =        (        A        ⋅                  B                      −            1                          )        B        .              {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}_{B}(A)=(A\cdot B^{-1})B.}  Just as the geometric derivative                     ∇              {\displaystyle \nabla }   is defined over the entire                     n              {\displaystyle n}  -dimensional space, we may wish to define an intrinsic derivative                     ∂              {\displaystyle \partial }  , locally defined on the manifold:                    ∂        F        =                                            P                                            B                          (        ∇        )        F        .              {\displaystyle \partial F={\mathcal {P}}_{B}(\nabla )F.}  (Note: The right hand side of the above may not lie in the tangent space to the manifold. Therefore, it is not the same as                                                         P                                            B                          (        ∇        F        )              {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}_{B}(\nabla F)}  , which necessarily does lie in the tangent space.)If                     a              {\displaystyle a}   is a vector tangent to the manifold, then indeed both the geometric derivative and intrinsic derivative give the same directional derivative:                    a        ⋅        ∂        F        =        a        ⋅        ∇        F        .              {\displaystyle a\cdot \partial F=a\cdot \nabla F.}  Although this operation is perfectly valid, it is not always useful because                     ∂        F              {\displaystyle \partial F}   itself is not necessarily on the manifold.  Therefore, we define the covariant derivative to be the forced projection of the intrinsic derivative back onto the manifold:                    a        ⋅        D        F        =                                            P                                            B                          (        a        ⋅        ∂        F        )        =                                            P                                            B                          (        a        ⋅                                            P                                            B                          (        ∇        )        F        )        .              {\displaystyle a\cdot DF={\mathcal {P}}_{B}(a\cdot \partial F)={\mathcal {P}}_{B}(a\cdot {\mathcal {P}}_{B}(\nabla )F).}  Since any general multivector can be expressed as a sum of a projection and a rejection, in this case                    a        ⋅        ∂        F        =                                            P                                            B                          (        a        ⋅        ∂        F        )        +                                            P                                            B                                ⊥                          (        a        ⋅        ∂        F        )        ,              {\displaystyle a\cdot \partial F={\mathcal {P}}_{B}(a\cdot \partial F)+{\mathcal {P}}_{B}^{\perp }(a\cdot \partial F),}  we introduce a new function, the shape tensor                                           S                          (        a        )              {\displaystyle {\mathsf {S}}(a)}  , which satisfies                    F        ×                              S                          (        a        )        =                                            P                                            B                                ⊥                          (        a        ⋅        ∂        F        )        ,              {\displaystyle F\times {\mathsf {S}}(a)={\mathcal {P}}_{B}^{\perp }(a\cdot \partial F),}  where                     ×              {\displaystyle \times }   is the commutator product.  In a local coordinate basis                     {                  e                      i                          }              {\displaystyle \{e_{i}\}}   spanning the tangent surface, the shape tensor is given by                                          S                          (        a        )        =                  e                      i                          ∧                                            P                                            B                                ⊥                          (        a        ⋅        ∂                  e                      i                          )        .              {\displaystyle {\mathsf {S}}(a)=e^{i}\wedge {\mathcal {P}}_{B}^{\perp }(a\cdot \partial e_{i}).}  Importantly, on a general manifold, the covariant derivative does not commute.  In particular, the commutator is related to the shape tensor by                    [        a        ⋅        D        ,                b        ⋅        D        ]        F        =        −        (                              S                          (        a        )        ×                              S                          (        b        )        )        ×        F        .              {\displaystyle [a\cdot D,\,b\cdot D]F=-({\mathsf {S}}(a)\times {\mathsf {S}}(b))\times F.}  Clearly the term                                           S                          (        a        )        ×                              S                          (        b        )              {\displaystyle {\mathsf {S}}(a)\times {\mathsf {S}}(b)}   is of interest.  However it, like the intrinsic derivative, is not necessarily on the manifold.  Therefore, we can define the Riemann tensor to be the projection back onto the manifold:                                          R                          (        a        ∧        b        )        =        −                                            P                                            B                          (                              S                          (        a        )        ×                              S                          (        b        )        )        .              {\displaystyle {\mathsf {R}}(a\wedge b)=-{\mathcal {P}}_{B}({\mathsf {S}}(a)\times {\mathsf {S}}(b)).}  Lastly, if                     F              {\displaystyle F}   is of grade                     r              {\displaystyle r}  , then we can define interior and exterior covariant derivatives as                    D        ⋅        F        =        ⟨        D        F                  ⟩                      r            −            1                          ,              {\displaystyle D\cdot F=\langle DF\rangle _{r-1},}                      D        ∧        F        =        ⟨        D        F                  ⟩                      r            +            1                          ,              {\displaystyle D\wedge F=\langle DF\rangle _{r+1},}  and likewise for the intrinsic derivative.
