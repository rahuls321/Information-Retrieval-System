Etymology[edit]
The origin of the name is obscure. The first known written mention of the place is given as Wotokymund in a letter of March 1821 to the Madras Gazette from an unknown correspondent.[5] In early times it was called Ottakal Mandu. The name probably changed under British rule from Udhagamandalam to Ootacamund, and later was shortened to Ooty.[6]
The first part of the name (Ootaca) is probably a corruption of the local name for the central region of the Nilgiri Plateau.[7] Otha-Cal literally means "single stone". This is perhaps a reference to a sacred stone revered by the local Toda people.
"Mund" is the Anglicised form of the Toda word for a village, Mandu.[8]
Ooty is in the Nilgiri hills, meaning the "blue mountains", so named due to the Kurunji flower which blooms every twelve years giving the slopes a bluish tinge.[5][9][10]

History[edit]
  Ooty in 1903
  Ooty, India (c. 2011)
Udhagamandalam was originally a tribal land occupied by the Tamil, Toda, Kota, Irula and
Kurumba
The Toda in Nilgiris are first referenced in a record belonging to Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana and his general Punisa, dated 1117 CE.[9] The Toda people were known for raising water buffalo. The people known for farming activities.[10] Nilgiris was ruled by various dynasties like Satavahanas, Gangas, Kadambas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas, the Vijayanagara empire and the Rajas of Ummattur (on behalf of Wodeyars of Mysuru).[9][11][12][13][14] Tipu Sultan captured Nilgiris in the eighteenth century and extended the border by constructing a hideout cave-like structure.[10] The Nilgiris came into possession of British East India Company as part of the ceded lands, held by Tipu Sultan, by the treaty of Srirangapatnam in 1799.
In 1818, J. C. Whish and N. W. Kindersley, assistants to John Sullivan, then Collector of Coimbatore, visited Ooty and submitted a report to him. Sullivan camped at Dimbhatti, north of Kotagiri in January 1819 and was enthralled by the beauty of the place. He wrote to Thomas Munro,
" ... it resembles Switzerland, more than any country of Europe... the hills beautifully wooded and fine strong spring with running water in every valley."[15] The Toda ceded that part of the town to Sullivan and in May 1819, he began to build his bungalow at Dimbhatti. He also started work on a road from Sirumugai to Dimbhatti that year. The road was completed in May 1823, and extended up to Coonoor by 1830–32.[5]
Aranmore Palace in Ooty, served as the summer capital of the Madras Presidency; it was visited by British officials during the colonial days as a popular summer resort.[16] Soldiers were sent to nearby Wellington to recuperate. Wellington is the home of the Madras Regiment of the Indian Army.[17][18] After Independence, it developed into a popular hill resort.

Geography and climate[edit]
Location[edit]
Ooty is situated in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Many of the forested areas and water bodies are off-limits to most visitors in order to protect this fragile ecosystem. Some areas of the Biosphere Reserve have been earmarked for tourism development, and steps are being undertaken to open these areas to visitors whilst conserving the area.[19] It is situated at an altitude of 2,240 metres (7,350 feet) above sea level.[1]

Climate[edit]
  Boat House on Ooty Lake
Ooty features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under Köppen climate classification.[20] Despite its location in the tropics, in contrast with most of South India, Ooty generally features mild conditions and is spring-like throughout the year. However, night time in the months of January and February is typically cold. Temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the year; with average high temperatures ranging from about 17–20 °C (63–68 °F) and average low temperatures between approximately 5–12 °C (41–54 °F).
The highest temperature ever recorded in Ooty was 28.5 °C (83.3 °F), which by South Asian standards is uncharacteristically low for an all-time record high temperature. The rainy season in Ooty is generally cool and windy with high humidity. The wind chill may fall to as low as 5 °C (41 °F) during the day time. Wind is always high throughout the year. The lowest temperature was −2 °C (28 °F).[21] The city sees on average about 105 centimetres or 41 inches of precipitation annually, with a marked drier season from December through March.

  Xerochrysum bracteatum – Everlasting flower from Ooty
The 22-acre (89,000 m2) Ooty Botanical Gardens was laid out in 1847[29] and is maintained by the Government of Tamil Nadu. The Botanical Garden is lush, green, and well-maintained. A flower show along with an exhibition of rare plant species is held every May. The gardens have around a thousand species, both exotic and indigenous, of plants, shrubs, ferns, trees, herbal and bonsai plants.[30] The garden has a 20-million-year-old fossilised tree.[31][32]
Deer Park is located on the edge of Ooty Lake. It is the highest altitude zoo in India aside from the zoo in Nainital, Uttarakhand. This park was formed to house a number of species of deer and other animals.[33]

Lakes and dams[edit]
  Ooty Lake
Ooty lake covers an area of 65 acres.[34] The boat house established alongside the lake, which offers boating facilities to tourists, is a major tourist attraction in Ooty. It was constructed in 1824 by John Sullivan, the first collector of Ooty. The lake was formed by damming the mountain streams flowing down Ooty valley.[34] The lake is set among groves of Eucalyptus trees with a railway line running along one bank. During the summer season in May, boat races and boat pageantry are organised for two days at the lake.[35][36]

  Boating in Pykara Lake in Ooty
Pykara is a river located 19 km from Ooty.[37] The Pykara is considered very sacred by the Todas.[38] The Pykara river rises at Mukurthi peak and passes through a hilly tract, generally keeping to the north and turns to the west after reaching the plateau's edge.[38] The river flows through a series of cascades; and the last two falls of 55 meters and 61 meters are known as Pykara falls.[38] The falls are approximately 6 km from the bridge on the main road. A boat house by the Pykara falls and dam is an added attraction to tourists.[37][39] Kamaraj Sagar Dam (also known as Sandynalla reservoir)[40] is located 10 km from the Ooty bus stand.[41][42] It is a picnic spot and a film shoot location on the slopes of the Wenlock Downs.[43] The various tourist activities at the dam include fishing and studying nature and the environment.[44] Parsons Valley Reservoir is the primary water source for the town and is mainly in a reserved forest and thus largely off-limits to visitors. Emerald Lake, Avalanche Lake and Porthimund Lake are other lakes in the region.

Tribal huts and museum[edit]
  Toda Hut
There are a few Toda huts on the hills above the Botanical Garden, where Todas still dwell. There are other Toda settlements in the area, notably Kandal Mund near Old Ooty. Although many Toda have abandoned their traditional distinctive huts for concrete houses,[45] a movement is now afoot to build tradition barrel-vaulted huts, and during the last decade forty new huts have been built and many Toda sacred dairies renovated.[46]
The Tribal Museum is part of the campus of Tribal Research Centre which is in Muthorai Palada (10 km from Ooty town). It is home to rare artifacts and photographs of tribal groups of Tamil Nadu as well as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and anthropological and archaeological primitive human culture and heritage. The Tribal Museum also displays houses belonging to Toda, Kota, Paniya, Kurumba, and Kanikarans.

Nilgiri Mountain Railway[edit]
  Nilgiri Mountain Railway
The Nilgiri Mountain Railway was built by the British in 1908,[47] and was initially operated by the Madras Railway Company. The railway still relies on its fleet of steam locomotives.[48] NMR comes under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Salem Division. In July 2005, UNESCO added the Nilgiri Mountain Railway as an extension to the World Heritage Site of Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, the site then became known as "Mountain Railways of India."[49] after it satisfied the necessary criteria, thus forcing abandonment of the modernisation plans. For the past several years diesel locomotives have taken over from steam on the section between Coonoor and Udhagamandalam. Local people and tourists have led a demand for steam locos to once again haul this section.[48]

Historical buildings[edit]
  Fernhills Palace
Stone House is the first bungalow constructed in Ooty. It was built by John Sullivan and was called Kal Bangala by the tribals (Kal means stone in local tribal language). John Sullivan started building Stone House in 1822, acquiring land from the Todas at one rupee an acre.[15] Today, it is the official residence for the principal of the Government Arts College, Ooty[50][51]
St Stephen's Church is located on the road to Mysore in Ooty,[52] in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the oldest churches in the Nilgiris district.[53][54] The church dates back to the 19th century. Stephen Rumbold Lushington, the then governor of Madras, who keenly felt the need for a cathedral in Ooty which was exclusively for the British, laid the foundation stone for the church on 23 April 1829, to coincide with the birthday of King George IV. St Stephen's Church was consecrated by John Matthias Turner, Bishop of Calcutta, on 5 November 1830. It was thrown open to public communion on Easter Sunday 3 April 1831. It came under the Church of South India in 1947.[35] The architect in charge was John James Underwood, Captain, Madras Regiment.[55]
St. Thomas Church, a parish in the Anglican diocese of Ooty,[56] was begun in 1867, with the foundation stone being laid on 1 May by Lt. Gen. Howard Dowker. Construction was completed 20 October 1870, and its first service was held in 1871.[57] Among the famous graves in the churchyard are those of Josiah John Goodwin, the British stenographer of Swami Vivekananda, and William Patrick Adam, the British governor of Madras, whose grave is topped by the stunning pillar monument dedicated to St. Thomas, the tallest structure in Ooty. The church's graveyard was used as a setting in David Lean's 1984 movie, A Passage to India, which was based on E. M. Forster's novel of the same name.[58][59]
In 1882, the rules of the game of snooker were first drafted and codified in the "Ooty Club" by Sir Neville Chamberlain (not the Prime Minister). The club still houses the billiards table that was used.[60][61]

Tea Factory[edit]
Spread over an area of nearly one acre of land, the Ooty Tea Factory is situated close to Ooty town.  Visitors can learn about the origin of different kinds of tea leaves all across the globe and the history of tea in India. In the factory, the process of tea processing by Cut, Twist and Curl (CTC) machines is clearly displayed.  At the end of the visit, one can taste different types of tea and buy tea souvenirs.  Other nearby tea factories include Doddabetta Tea factory and Bench Mark Tea Factory.

In 1882, a Swiss engineer named Arthur Riggenbach came to the Nilgiri Hills on an invitation from Government of India and he submitted an estimate for a line costing GB£132,000. The Nilgiri Railway Company was formed in 1885 and planning work commenced in 1886. The work on the line commenced in August 1891 and the Mettupalayam-Coonoor section of the track was opened for traffic on 15 June 1899. In January 1903, the Indian Government purchased the line, and took over the construction of the extension from Coonoor to Ooty.
The Nilgiri Mountain Railway was operated by the Madras Railway until 31 December 1907 on the behalf of the Government. In January 1908, the railway line was handed over to South Indian Railway. The line from Coonoor to Ooty was completed in 1908. On 15 October, Arthur Lawley, Governor of Madras opened the new railway to traffic.[89] The Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) is one of the oldest mountain railways in India and was declared by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in July 2005. It is the only rack railway in India, and uses the Abt system.

Air[edit]
The nearest airport is Coimbatore, around 96 km (60 mi) away. Mysore Airport is 120 km away, Calicut International Airport is 140 km away and Bengaluru Kempegowda International Airport is 273 km away. Ooty has three helipads, one at Theettukal and two at Kodanad. The Theettukal helipad was approved by Airports Authority of India for defence and VIP services. Pawan Hans was supposed to start its service with Bell 407, but being surrounded by farmland, disruption of the farm animals there has put the operations on hold for commercial activities.[92][93][94][95]

Biodiversity and Wildlife[edit]

  Tiger in Mudumalai National Park
Ooty is part of the ecoregion South Western Ghats montane rain forests . Doddabetta is the highest peak (2,623 m) in the Nilgiris, about 10 km from Ooty. It lies at the junction of the Western Ghats surrounded by dense Sholas. The pine forest situated between Ooty and Thalakunda is a small downhill region where pine trees are arranged in an orderly fashion. Wenlock Downs is a grassland area typical of the original bioscape of the Nilgiris with gently undulating hills.
Mudumalai National Park and tiger reserve lies on the north western side of the Nilgiri Hills, about 31 km (19 mi) from Ooty.   Mudumalai is a haven for animals and birds, including elephants and tigers. The tiger population in Mudumalai is 103. Mukurthi National Park is a 78.46 km2 protected area located in the south-eastern corner of the Nilgiris Plateau about 25 km (16 mi)west of Ooty. The park was created to protect its keystone species, the Nilgiri tahr. The Western Ghats, Nilgiri Sub-Cluster (6,000 km2 (2,300 sq mi)), including all of Mudumalai National Park, is under consideration by the UNESCO World Heritage Committee for selection as a World Heritage Site.[96]

Education[edit]
Boarding schools such as Blue Mountains School have been a feature of Ooty since the days of the British Raj. They offer a significant contribution to the local economy. The facilities and standards of education are considered amongst the highest in India, and so these schools are popular amongst the elite of India and some of the neighbouring countries.[citation needed]
