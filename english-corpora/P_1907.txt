SECTION CII
"Yudhishthira said, 'O grandsire, it has been said that all pious men
attain to the same region after death. Is it true, O Bharata, that there
is difference of position or status among them?'
"Bhishma said, 'By different deeds, O son of Pritha, men attain to
different regions. They who are righteous in conduct attain to regions of
felicity, while they who are sinful attain to regions that are fraught
with misery. In this connection is cited the old narrative of the
discourse, O son, between the ascetic Gautama and Vasava. A certain
Brahmana of the name of Gautama, mild and self-restrained and with all
his senses under complete control, beheld an infant elephant that had
lost his mother and that was exceedingly cheerless on that account. Full
of compassion and steady in the observance of his vows, the ascetic
nursed that infant animal. After a long time the little beast grew up
into a large and mighty elephant. One day, Indra, assuming the form of
king Dhritarashtra, seized that mighty elephant which was as huge as a
hill and from whose rent temples the juice was trickling down. Beholding
the elephant dragged away, the great ascetic Gautama of rigid vows
addressed king Dhritarashtra and said, 'O ungrateful Dhritarashtra, do
not rob me of this elephant. It is looked upon by me as a son and I have
reared it with much pain. It is said that between the righteous,
friendship springs up if only they exchange seven words.[452] Thou
shouldst see, O king, that the sin of injuring a friend does not touch
thee! It behoveth thee not, O king, to take away by force this elephant
that brings me my fuel and water, that protects my asylum when I am away,
that exceedingly docile and obedient to his instructor, that is mindful
of doing all the offices that his preceptor commands, that is mild and
well-broken, and that is grateful and very dear to me! Indeed, thou
shouldst not bear it away, disregarding my protestations and cries!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'I shall give thee a thousand kine, a hundred
maid-servants, and five hundred pieces of gold. I shall also, O great
Rishi, give thee diverse other kinds of wealth. What use can Brahmanas
have with elephants?'
"Gautama said, Keep, O king, thy kine and maid-servants and coins of gold
and various gems and diverse other kinds of wealth! What, O monarch, have
Brahmanas to do with wealth?'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'Brahmana, have no use for elephants. Verily, O
learned Brahmana, elephants are meant for persons of the royal order. In
taking away an animal, viz., this foremost of elephants, for my use as
vehicle, I cannot be regarded as committing any sin. Do thou cease
obstructing me in this way, O Gautama!'
"Gautama said, 'O illustrious king, repairing even to that region of Yama
where the righteous live in joy and the sinful in grief, I shall take
from thee this my elephant!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'They that are destitute of (religious) acts, they
that have no faith and are atheists, they that are of sinful souls and
are always engaged in gratifying their senses, only they have to go to
the region of Yama and endure the misery he inflicts. Dhritarashtra shall
go to a higher region, and not thither!'
"Gautama said, 'The region of Yama is such that men are there controlled.
No untruth can be told there. Only truth prevails in that place. There
the weak persecute the strong. Repairing. thither I shall force thee to
yield up this elephant to me!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'Only those persons, that intoxicated with pride,
conduct themselves towards their eldest sister and father and mother as
towards foes, have to repair, O great ascetic, to such a region. I shall
repair to a higher region. Indeed, Dhritarashtra shall not have to go
thither!'
"Gautama said, 'The region, called Mandakini, of king Vaisravana is
attained by those highly blessed persons for whom are every joy and
comfort. There Gandharvas and Yakshas and Apsaras live (gladdening all
the denizens with enchanting dances and music). Repairing even thither, O
king, I shall force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those persons who regard hospitality to guests as a
vow, who are observant of good vows (having other objects), who give
shelter to Brahmanas, and who eat what remains after distribution among
all those that are dependent upon them, adorn the region called Mandakini
of Kuvera. (I shall not go thither, for a higher region is reserved for
me)!'
"Gautama said, 'If thou repairest to those delightful woods decked with
flowers, that stand on the summit of Meru, that echo with melodious voice
of Kinnaris, and that are graced with beautiful Jamvus of wide-spreading
branches, I shall proceed even thither and force thee to yield up this
elephant to me!'
'Dhritarashtra said, 'Those Brahmanas that are endued with mild
dispositions, that are devoted to truth, that are possessed of great
learning in the scriptures, that are compassionate unto all creatures,
that study the Puranas with all the histories, that pour libations on the
sacred fire and make gifts of honey unto the Brahmanas, repair to such
regions, O great Rishi! I shall repair to a region that is higher. Indeed
Dhritarashtra shall not go thither. If thou art acquainted with any other
well-known region of felicity, speak unto me, for I shall repair even
thither!'
"Gautama said, 'If thou proceedest to the woods owned by Narada and held
dear by him, that are adorned with flowers and that echo with the
melodious songs of the prince of Kinnaras, and that are the eternal abode
of Gandharvas and Apsaras, I shall follow thee thither and force thee to
yield up this elephant to me!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'They who never solicit alms, they who cultivate
music and dancing, and always rove about in joy, proceed to such regions.
O great Rishi, I shall repair to a region that is higher. Indeed,
Dhritarashtra shall not have to go thither!'
"Gautama said, 'If thou goest to that region where the Uttara-Kurus blaze
in beauty and pass their days in gladness, O king, in the company of the
very deities, where those beings that have their origin in fire, those
that have their origin in water, and those having their origin in
mountains, reside in happiness, and where Sakra raineth down the fruition
of every wish, and where women live in perfect freedom, unrestrained by
rules of any kind regulating their conduct of motions, and where there is
no feeling of jealousy between the sexes,--if thou repairest thither,
even thither shall I proceed and force thee to yield up this elephant to
me!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those men that are freed from desire with respect
to all articles of enjoyment, that abstain from meat, that never take up
the rod of chastisement, and never inflict the least harm on mobile and
immobile creatures, that have constituted themselves the soul of all
creatures, that are entirely freed from the idea of meum, that have cast
off attachments of every kind, that regard gain and loss as also praise
and blame as equal,--only those men, O great Rishi, repair to such
regions. I shall repair to a higher region. Verily, Dhritarashtra shall
not go thither!'
"Gautama said, 'Next to these blaze in beauty those eternal regions,
redolent with excellent perfumes, that are free from passions of every
kind and that are destitute of sorrow. These constitute the abode of the
high-souled king Soma. If thou repairest thither, even thither shall I
proceed and force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those men that always make gifts without receiving
any gift, who never accept any service from others, who own nothing which
they cannot give to a deserving person, who are hospitable to all
creatures, who are inclined to show grace to every one, who are endued
with forgiving dispositions, who never speak ill of others, who protect
all creatures by throwing over them the shroud of compassion, and who are
always righteous in their behaviour,--only those men, O great Rishi,
proceed to such regions. I shall proceed to a higher region. Verily,
Dhritarashtra shall not go there!'
"Gautama said, 'Next to these blaze in beauty other regions that are
eternal, free from passion and darkness and sorrow, and that lie at the
foot of the high-souled deity of the Sun. If thou repairest thither, even
thither shall I go and force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those men that are attentive to the study of the
Vedas, that are devoted to the service of their preceptors, that are
observant of penances and excellent vows, that are firm in truth, that
never utter anything that smacks of disobedience or enmity to their
preceptors, that are always alert, and ever ready in service of seniors
and preceptors,--they repair, O great Rishi, to such regions, they that
are pure (of mind and body), that are endued with cleansed souls, that
are of restrained speech, that are firm in truth, and that are
well-versed in the Vedas. I shall proceed to a higher region! Verily,
Dhritarashtra shall not go thither!'
"Gautama said, 'Next to those are the eternal regions that blaze in
beauty, that are redolent with excellent perfumes, that are free from
passion, and that are free from every sorrow. They constitute the abode
of the high-souled king Varuna. If thou proceedest thither, even thither
shall I go and force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those men who worship the deities by observing the
vow called Chaturmasya, that perform a hundred and ten sacrifices, that
pour libations every day on their sacred fire with devotion and faith for
three years agreeably with the ordinances declared in the Vedas, that
bear without flinching the burden of all duties, that walk steadily along
the way trod by the righteous, that steadily sustain the course of
conduct followed by the righteous-souled,--only they repair to such
regions. I shall repair to a higher region. Verily, Dhritarashtra shall
not go thither!'
"Gautama said, 'Above them are the regions of Indra, free from passion
and sorrow, that are difficult of access and coveted by all men.
Proceeding even to the abode of Indra himself of mighty energy, I shall,
O king, force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'He who lives for a hundred years, who is endued
with heroism, who studies the Vedas, and who performs sacrifices with
devotion, verity, such men proceed to the region of Sakra. I shall repair
to a higher region. Verily, Dhritarashtra shall not go there!'
"Gautama said, 'Above the Heavens are the regions of the Prajapatis of
superior felicity abounding in every happiness, and divested of sorrow.
Belonging to those puissant ones from whom the creation has sprung, they
are coveted by all persons. If thou repairest thither, even thither shall
I go and force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'Those kings that have bathed upon the completion of
the Rajasuya sacrifice, that are endued with righteous souls, that have
protected their subjects properly, and that have washed their limbs with
sanctified water upon the completion of the horse-sacrifice, repair to
such regions. Verily, Dhritarashtra shall not go there!'
"Gautama said, 'Next to those, blaze in beauty those eternal regions,
redolent with delicious perfumes, free from passion, and transcending all
sorrow. Those are the regions of kine difficult of attainment where
oppression can never be. If thou repairest thither, I shall proceed even
thither and force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'He who, owning thousand kine, gives away a hundred
kine every year, or owning a hundred kine gives away ten every year to
the best of his might, or owning only ten or even five kine gives away
therefrom one cow, and they who attain to a mature old age practising the
vows of Brahmacharya all their days, who obey the declarations of the
Vedas, and who, endued with energy of mind, betake themselves to
pilgrimages to sacred waters and shrines, dwell in felicity in the region
of kine. They who repair to Prabhasa and Manasa, the lakes of Pushkara,
the large lake called Mahatsara, the sacred woods of Naimisha, Vahuda,
Karatoya, Ganga, Gayasiras, Vipasa, Sthulavaluka, Krishna, the five
rivers (of the Punjab), the extensive lake called Mahahrada, Gomati,
Kausiki, Champa, Saraswati, Drisadwati, and Yamuna,--indeed, those
illustrious Brahmanas, steady in the observance of vows, who go to these
sacred waters,--repair to the regions of which thou speakest. Endued with
celestial bodies and adorned with celestial garlands those blessed
individuals, always emitting the most delightful perfumes, repair to
those regions of joy and gladness. Verily, Dhritarashtra shall not go
there!'
"Gautama said, 'Next to these are regions where there is no fear of the
least cold or heat, no hunger, no thirst, no pain, no sorrow, no joy, no
one that is agreeable or disagreeable, on friend, and on enemy: where
decrepitude and death are not, and where there is neither righteousness
nor sin. Proceeding even to that region which is freed from passion,
which abounds with equable happiness, and where there is wisdom and the:
tribute of Sattwa,--verily, proceeding to even that sacred abode of the
self-born Brahman,--I shall force thee to yield up this elephant to me!'
"Dhritarashtra said, 'They who are freed from all attachments, who are
possessed of cleansed souls, who are steady in the observance of the
foremost vows, who are devoted to the Yoga that depends on tranquillising
the mind, and who have (in this life) attained to the happiness of
heaven,--those persons wedded to the attribute of Sattwa--attain to the
sacred region of Brahman. O great ascetic, thou shalt not be able to
discover Dhritarashtra there!'
"Gautama said, 'There where the foremost of Rathantaras is sung, where
altars are strewn with the sacred Kusa blades, for the performance of
Pundarika sacrifices, there where Soma-drinking Brahmanas go on vehicles
drawn by excellent steeds,[453] proceeding even thither I shall force
thee to yield up this elephant. I think, thou art the slayer of Vritra,
viz., the deity that has performed a hundred sacrifices, engaged in
roving through all the regions of the universe! I hope, I have not,
through mental weakness (not recognising thee before) committed any fault
by the words I have addressed thee!'
"The deity of a hundred sacrifices said, 'Yes, I am Maghavat. I came to
the world of human beings, for seizing this elephant. I bow to thee. Do
thou command me! I shall readily accomplish all that thou mayst be
pleased to say!'
"Gautama said, 'Do thou give me, O chief of the deities, this elephant
that is of white complexion and that is so young, for it is only ten
years of age. I have brought it up as a child of my own. Dwelling in
these woods, it has grown under my eye and has been to me a dear
companion. Do thou set free this my child that thou hast seized and
wishest to drag away!'
"The deity of a hundred sacrifices said, 'This elephant that has been a
son to thee, O foremost of Brahmanas, cometh to thee looking wishfully at
thee! Behold, it sniffs thy feet with its nostrils! My salutations to
thee! Do thou pray for my welfare!'
"Gautama said, 'O chief of the deities, I do always think of thy good! I
always offer thee worship! Do thou also, O Sakra, bestow thy blessings on
me! Given by thee, I accept this elephant!'
"The deity of a hundred sacrifices said, 'Amongst all those high-souled
and foremost of Rishis that firmly adhere to truth and that have the
Vedas planted in their heart, thou alone hast been able to recognise me.
For this reason I am exceedingly pleased with thee! Do thou, therefore, O
Brahmana, come with me quickly, accompanied by this thy son! Thou
deservest to attain to diverse regions of great felicity without the
delay of even a single day!'
"Bhishma continued, 'Having said these words, the wielder of the
thunderbolt, taking Gautama with him and placing him before, along with
his son, viz., that elephant, proceeded to heaven, that is difficult of
attainment by even the righteous. He who would listen to this history
every day or would recite it, restraining his senses the while,
proceedeth (after death) to the region of Brahman even as Gautama
himself.'"
