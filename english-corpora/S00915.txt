Early life and education[edit]
Mannering was born in 1954 (November) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated from suburban Pittsburgh's South Fayette High School, received his B.Eng. degree from the University of Saskatchewan, M.S. degree from Purdue University, and Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where his doctoral committee consisted of Clifford Winston (Advisor), Daniel McFadden (2000 Nobel Prize laureate in Economics) and Ann Fetter Friedlaender.

Career[edit]
Mannering is currently a Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering (with a courtesy appointment in Economics) and Executive Director of the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida. He previously held academic positions as Head of Civil Engineering and later as the Charles Pankow Professor at Purdue University where he received the Murphy Teaching Award, Purdue's highest undergraduate teaching honor.[1][2] Prior to joining Purdue University, he was a Professor and Chair of Civil and Environmental Engineering[3] at the University of Washington and an Assistant Professor at the Pennsylvania State University.
Mannering has received numerous awards in his discipline. In 2005 he won the Wilbur S. Smith Award,[4] and in 2009 the James Laurie Prize [5] for his work in highway safety (both awarded by the American Society of Civil Engineers). In 2016, he was named by the Eno Foundation as one of the Top 10 Transportation Thought Leaders in  Academia[6] and in 2019, his work on highway accident frequency analysis was recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers journal editor as one of four Journal of Transportation Engineering Part A: Systems papers that have been instrumental in moving civil engineering forward or have changed the practice of transportation engineering, infrastructure, and development.[7] In 2019, 2020 and again in 2021, he was on Clarivate's list of the world's most influential researchers of the past decade, who were recognized for the production of multiple highly cited papers that rank in the top 1% by citations for field and year in Web of Science.[8][9][10] In 2020, Mannering was recognized as the most highly-cited author (highest total citations and citations per paper) in the 50-year history of the journal Accident Analysis and Prevention[11] and he received the Council of University Transportation Centers (HNTB-CUTC) Lifetime Achievement Award in 2021.[12]

Research[edit]
Mannering is known for his work in statistics, econometrics, and highway safety. He has published extensively with over 150 journal articles.[13][14] Some of his most impactful work includes research on household vehicle ownership and utilization,[15] highway accident frequency and injury severity,[16][17] the effects of unobserved heterogeneity in highway safety analysis,[18] and his work on temporal instability in the analysis of highway accident data.[19] He has contributed to the advancement of science and engineering through his teaching and as an author of two widely adopted textbooks: Principles of Highway Engineering and Traffic Analysis and Statistical and Econometric Methods for Transportation Data Analysis. Mannering is Editor-in-Chief (and founding Editor) of the journal Analytic Methods in Accident Research[20] and past Editor-in-Chief and current Distinguished Editorial Board Member of the journal Transportation Research Part B - Methodological.[21]
