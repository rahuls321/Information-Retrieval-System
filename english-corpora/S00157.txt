Scientific misconduct is the violation of the standard codes of scholarly conduct and ethical behavior in the publication of professional scientific research.  A Lancet review on Handling of Scientific Misconduct in Scandinavian countries gave examples of policy definitions. In Denmark, scientific misconduct is defined as "intention[al] or gross negligence leading to fabrication of the scientific message or a false credit or emphasis given to a scientist", and in Sweden as "intention[al] distortion of the research process by fabrication of data, text, hypothesis, or methods from another researcher's manuscript form or publication; or distortion of the research process in other ways."[1][2]
A 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis of survey data found that about 2% of scientists admitted to falsifying, fabricating, or modifying data at least once.[3]

Biology and Biomedical sciences[edit]
Vojtěch Adam (CZ), a Professor and ex-rector of Mendel University in Brno, Czech Republic,[4] was forced to resign as a Rector of Mendel University after a major scientific fraud and data manipulation was discovered in at least 9 papers published by him. Initially, 26 papers were suspected as fraudulent and published at PubPeer by Elisabeth Bik.[5] Afterward, an independent committee was established at the Central European Institute of Technology in Brno to investigate these allegations. They found major scientific frauds such as intentional data manipulations, duplicates in microscopy images, remarkable similarities in noise patterns, and duplicated bands in western blots. The committee concluded "Taken together, the Committee concludes that the published work carried out in the laboratory of Prof. Adam and evaluated by the Committee did not adhere to the principles of good scientific practice. The issues ranged from gross negligence in quality control to clear signs of data manipulation. The Committee recommends retracting at least 6 papers to correct the scientific record." They further commented "It was particularly concerning that in at least two cases, discrepancies appeared also in the data provided to the Committee as corrections. Moreover, the explanation of the discrepancies presented to the Committee differed from the explanations given to the media (Figure 1E in Merlos Rodrigo et al., (2018) commented on in DenikN newspaper1). The Committee leaves the interpretation of these observations to others."[6]

Ching-Shih Chen (US), the former chair of cancer research at Ohio State University, was investigated by OSU and the federal Office of Research Integrity after being anonymously reported for falsifying data. The investigation found that Chen mishandled images and figures in published papers, "intentionally falsified data", and did not keep any laboratory notebooks on his research, a violation of federal research policies.[37][38][39] As of 2021 Chen has had ten research publications retracted, two other papers have received an expression of concern, and five other papers have been corrected.[40]
Carlo M. Croce (US), an oncologist and professor of medicine at Ohio State University, has been the subject of several allegations of scientific misconduct, including data falsification, and related institutional investigations.[41][42][43] Croce, who has been described as a "serial plaintiff",[44] has filed lawsuits against critics,[45] including a defamation claim against The New York Times that in 2018 was dismissed,[46] a defamation lawsuit he lost against David Sanders of Purdue University[47][48] and a lawsuit he lost against Ohio State University to reclaim a department chair position from which he was removed.[49] As of 2021, Croce has had ten of his publications retracted, three others have received an expression of concern, and 21 others have been corrected.[50]

Yoshitaka Fujii (Japan), an anesthesiologist, was found to have fabricated data in at least 183 scientific papers, setting what is believed to be a record for the number of papers by a single author requiring retractions. A committee reviewing 212 papers published by Fujii over a span of 20 years found that 126 were entirely fabricated, with no scientific work done. Only 3 were found to be valid. He was also found to have forged the signatures of scientists he listed as co-authors without their knowledge.[64][65][66] As of 2021, Fujii has had 173 of their research publications retracted, and seven others have received an expression of concern.[67]

Recent disclosures of fraudulent or flawed studies in medical and scientific journals have called into question as never before the merits of their peer-review system. The system is based on journals inviting independent experts to critique submitted manuscripts. The stated aim is to weed out sloppy and bad research, ensuring the integrity of what it has published.
