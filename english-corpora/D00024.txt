No.TitleDirected byWritten byOriginal release date1"The Consultation"Michael ShowalterGeorgia PritchettNovember 12, 2021 (2021-11-12)
In 1982, Martin "Marty" Markowitz visits Dr. Isaac "Ike" Herschkopf under the advice of his sister, Phyllis Shapiro, in order to help with his anxiety attacks and grief after their parents' recent deaths. Ike's unconventional method manages to help Marty as he takes him outside to play basketball and eat lunch, and he helps him with a problem concerning his recently broken-up girlfriend. Satisfied with his first session, Marty decides to return while also forming a bond with him. In 2010, Ike hosts a party at a large house, while later in the night, the caretaker vandalizes the backyard in anger and frustration. The caretaker is revealed to be Marty.
2"The Ceremony"Michael ShowalterStuart ZichermanNovember 12, 2021 (2021-11-12)
Nearing Marty's 40th birthday, Ike suggests he have a second Bar Mitzvah as Marty had not enjoyed his first due to anxiety and stomach problems. Phyllis, however, is against the idea, believing it will dishonor the memories of their parents. Marty and Ike go ahead with it anyway and Phyllis complains to her rabbi, causing him to lodge a complaint to Ike's rabbi, who, in turn, warns him about it. Marty later berates Phyllis about this, and they have an argument. On his birthday, Marty proceeds with the second Bar Mitzvah, though most of the people who show up are Ike's wife, Bonnie, and his friends. Meanwhile, Phyllis, believing Marty will abandon the idea, prepares his birthday celebration with her kids, only to be left in tears when Marty doesn't show.
3"The Treatment"Michael ShowalterEthan KuperbergNovember 12, 2021 (2021-11-12)
Phyllis asks Marty to open the family's trust fund so she could hire a better divorce lawyer after her ex-husband starts giving her a hard time. Ike gives Marty a business opportunity when a Broadway show requires his help to make a large curtain for the stage. The curtain ends up costing too much, and Marty's staff are unenthusiastic at solving the problem. Marty brings Ike to the company to motivate them, and they manage to solve the issue. Alarmed at the increasing closeness between the two, Phyllis visits Ike for a session, which ends badly. Marty later gets into another argument with her and refuses to unlock the trust. While Marty is out with Ike, Phyllis visits his apartment to talk with him but becomes angered at seeing how close her brother is to Ike. She then robs their parents' jewels from his vault. Returning home and reading Phyllis' message, Marty calls Ike and asks him for help, in the process revealing his large inheritance. Realizing the extent of Marty's wealth, Ike inserts himself into Marty's life even further.
4"The Foundation"Michael ShowalterAdam CounteeNovember 19, 2021 (2021-11-19)
Marty officially cuts Phyllis out from his life and hires Ike as a consultant at the fabric company, which annoys the company staff. Ike becomes a father to twin girls, but he refuses to hire help even as Bonnie becomes overwhelmed with the babies. This prompts her to hire the help anyway using her own money. Under Ike's influence, Marty starts a foundation with him, mostly using Marty's money. Marty later scores a date with Hannah, a girl who works at a frame shop that he and Ike often visit. Ike suggests taking her out to an expensive charity gala for the date. During the gala, both Hannah and Marty become uncomfortable at Ike's blatant claims and his irresponsible use of Marty's money. The night ends with Marty having a heart attack and being taken to a hospital after Ike spends $20,000 of Marty's money during an auction. Ike later warns Hannah that she should let go of Marty for the good of his recovery.
5"The Family Tree"Jesse PeretzGeorgia Pritchett & Catherine ShepherdNovember 25, 2021 (2021-11-25)
In 1990, Ike's father passes away. Marty is invited to the funeral and offers Ike's family to stay in his Hamptons house for the weekend. Ike begins taking over the house, convincing Marty to redecorate, having him sleep in the guest house instead of the master bedroom, and extending his own stay in the house indefinitely as he plans to work on his novel's manuscript, while making Marty type it on his own. Disliking a large tree in the backyard, Ike tries to have Marty chop it down, but he refuses as it was the tree that his parents planted when they bought the house. Ike becomes angered and threatens to leave, forcing Marty to chop down the tree later in the night in order to salvage his relationship with him. One year later, under Ike's advice, Marty buys the property next door and combines it with the house.
6"The Party"Jesse PeretzGeorgia Pritchett & Sas GoldbergDecember 3, 2021 (2021-12-03)
Ike begins throwing a series of parties in Marty's Hamptons house, while making Marty serve his guests. In 1997, Marty witnesses Bonnie break down during one of the parties, saying that she doesn't recognize her husband anymore. In 2007, during another party, Marty meets with Miriam, one of Ike's patients. She warns him about Ike as he convinced her to cut off her relationship with her own mother, which she deeply regrets as she missed her death. While in town, Marty meets with a neighbor who talks about Phyllis' current life, making him realize how much he missed over the last few years. He attempts to run away from Ike, but can't bring himself to do so. While heading back to the city, the bus suddenly breaks down; however, it is revealed to be a ploy by Ike to strand Miriam at a nearby gas station while he cuts her off, stating that she is a toxic person.
7"The Breakthrough"Jesse PeretzCatherine Shepherd & Sas GoldbergDecember 10, 2021 (2021-12-10)
In 2010, Ike angrily refuses a plan to move the company to New Jersey to keep it from going under. Marty is diagnosed with a hernia and undergoes surgery. During his recovery, Ike never visits him at all. Marty escapes the hospital after four days and confronts Ike, finding out that he was hosting another party at the Hamptons house. Ike attempts to convince Marty that he did everything he could to help him, but when Marty finds out one of his kois has died as a result of Ike's neglect, he breaks down in front of Bonnie, saying he can't do it anymore. Later that night, Marty begins vandalizing the backyard as seen in the first episode. When Marty misses his next therapy session, Ike tries to contact him, only to find that he has moved the company to New Jersey without his knowledge. Ike confronts him, but is fired from the company by Marty as a result.
8"The Verdict"Jesse PeretzGeorgia PritchettDecember 17, 2021 (2021-12-17)
Marty returns to therapy with Ike, wanting to give him another chance. Ike continues with his old ways by having Marty as his best man at his wedding vows renewal, even though he and Bonnie have been separated for years. Marty tries to reconnect with Phyllis through her daughter, Nancy, but she angrily rebuffs him. When Marty finds out that the reason Hannah never called him back was because of Ike, he's finally convinced to cut him out from his life for good. Phyllis later confronts him at the Hamptons house for going near Nancy, but she ends up reconciling with him. Ike shows up while Marty and Phyllis are burning his stuff from the house, attempting to convince him again about Phyllis' toxicity. Marty finally stands up for himself and tells him to leave. One year later, Marty has fully reconnected with Phyllis and her family. He has also sued Dr. Ike in an attempt to get his license revoked. Ike tries to insert himself back into Marty's life one last time, but Marty, now immune to him, says he feels absolutely nothing. The textual epilogue shows that Dr. Ike's license was eventually revoked in 2021, and that Marty has never returned to therapy.
