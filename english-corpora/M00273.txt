In mathematics, and in particular, algebra, a generalized inverse (or, g-inverse) of an element x is an element y that has some properties of an inverse element but not necessarily all of them.  Generalized inverses can be defined in any mathematical structure that involves associative multiplication, that is, in a semigroup.  This article describes generalized inverses of a matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}  .A matrix                               A                                    g                                      ∈                              R                                n            ×            m                                {\displaystyle A^{\mathrm {g} }\in \mathbb {R} ^{n\times m}}   is a generalized inverse of a matrix                     A        ∈                              R                                m            ×            n                                {\displaystyle A\in \mathbb {R} ^{m\times n}}   if                     A                  A                                    g                                      A        =        A        .              {\displaystyle AA^{\mathrm {g} }A=A.}  The purpose of constructing a generalized inverse of a matrix is to obtain a matrix that can serve as an inverse in some sense for a wider class of matrices than invertible matrices.  A generalized inverse exists for an arbitrary matrix, and when a matrix has a regular inverse, this inverse is its unique generalized inverse. Motivation Consider the linear system                    A        x        =        y              {\displaystyle Ax=y}  where                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is an                     n        ×        m              {\displaystyle n\times m}   matrix and                     y        ∈                              R                          (        A        )        ,              {\displaystyle y\in {\mathcal {R}}(A),}   the column space of                     A              {\displaystyle A}  .  If                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is nonsingular (which implies                     n        =        m              {\displaystyle n=m}  ) then                     x        =                  A                      −            1                          y              {\displaystyle x=A^{-1}y}   will be the solution of the system.  Note that, if                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is nonsingular, then                    A                  A                      −            1                          A        =        A        .              {\displaystyle AA^{-1}A=A.}  Now suppose                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is rectangular (                    n        ≠        m              {\displaystyle n\neq m}  ), or square and singular. Then we need a right candidate                     G              {\displaystyle G}   of order                     m        ×        n              {\displaystyle m\times n}   such that for all                     y        ∈                              R                          (        A        )        ,              {\displaystyle y\in {\mathcal {R}}(A),}                      A        G        y        =        y        .              {\displaystyle AGy=y.}  That is,                     x        =        G        y              {\displaystyle x=Gy}   is a solution of the linear system                     A        x        =        y              {\displaystyle Ax=y}  . Equivalently, we need a matrix                     G              {\displaystyle G}   of order                     m        ×        n              {\displaystyle m\times n}   such that                    A        G        A        =        A        .              {\displaystyle AGA=A.}  Hence we can define the generalized inverse as follows:  Given an                     m        ×        n              {\displaystyle m\times n}   matrix                     A              {\displaystyle A}  , an                     n        ×        m              {\displaystyle n\times m}   matrix                     G              {\displaystyle G}   is said to be a generalized inverse of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   if                     A        G        A        =        A        .              {\displaystyle AGA=A.}  ‍ The matrix                               A                      −            1                                {\displaystyle A^{-1}}   has been termed a regular inverse of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   by some authors. Types The Penrose conditions define different generalized inverses for                     A        ∈                              R                                n            ×            m                                {\displaystyle A\in \mathbb {R} ^{n\times m}}   and                               A                                    g                                      ∈                              R                                m            ×            n                          :              {\displaystyle A^{\mathrm {g} }\in \mathbb {R} ^{m\times n}:}                      A                  A                                    g                                      A        =        A              {\displaystyle AA^{\mathrm {g} }A=A}                                A                                    g                                      A                  A                                    g                                      =                  A                                    g                                            {\displaystyle A^{\mathrm {g} }AA^{\mathrm {g} }=A^{\mathrm {g} }}                      (        A                  A                                    g                                                )                      ∗                          =        A                  A                                    g                                            {\displaystyle (AA^{\mathrm {g} })^{*}=AA^{\mathrm {g} }}                      (                  A                                    g                                      A                  )                      ∗                          =                  A                                    g                                      A        ,              {\displaystyle (A^{\mathrm {g} }A)^{*}=A^{\mathrm {g} }A,}  Where                                                               ∗                                {\displaystyle {}^{*}}   indicates conjugate transpose.  If                               A                                    g                                            {\displaystyle A^{\mathrm {g} }}   satisfies the first condition, then it is a generalized inverse of                     A              {\displaystyle A}  . If it satisfies the first two conditions, then it is a reflexive generalized inverse of                     A              {\displaystyle A}  .  If it satisfies all four conditions, then it is a pseudoinverse of                     A              {\displaystyle A}  , denoted by                               A                      +                                {\displaystyle A^{+}}  .  A pseudoinverse is sometimes called the Moore–Penrose inverse, after the pioneering works by E. H. Moore and Roger Penrose. When                     A              {\displaystyle A}   is non-singular, any generalized inverse                               A                                    g                                      =                  A                      −            1                                {\displaystyle A^{\mathrm {g} }=A^{-1}}   and is unique. Otherwise, there are an infinite number of                     I              {\displaystyle I}  -inverses for a given                     I              {\displaystyle I}   with less than 4 elements.  However, the pseudoinverse is unique. (Note:                     I              {\displaystyle I}   and                     I              {\displaystyle I}  -inverse are defined in the Penrose conditions sub-section below and should not be confused with another common use of                     I              {\displaystyle I}   to mean an identity matrix).There are other kinds of generalized inverse:One-sided inverse (right inverse

As noted above, the Penrose conditions are:                    A                  A                                    g                                      A        =        A              {\displaystyle AA^{\mathrm {g} }A=A}                                A                                    g                                      A                  A                                    g                                      =                  A                                    g                                            {\displaystyle A^{\mathrm {g} }AA^{\mathrm {g} }=A^{\mathrm {g} }}                                            (                          A                              A                                                      g                                                                        )                                ∗                          =        A                  A                                    g                                            {\displaystyle \left(AA^{\mathrm {g} }\right)^{*}=AA^{\mathrm {g} }}                                            (                                          A                                                      g                                                              A                        )                                ∗                          =                  A                                    g                                      A        .              {\displaystyle \left(A^{\mathrm {g} }A\right)^{*}=A^{\mathrm {g} }A.}  In contrast to above, here the numbering of the properties is relevant; this numbering is used in the literature. An                     I              {\displaystyle I}  -inverse of                     A              {\displaystyle A}  , where                     I        ⊂        {        1        ,        2        ,        3        ,        4        }              {\displaystyle I\subset \{1,2,3,4\}}  , is a generalized inverse of                     A              {\displaystyle A}   which satisfies the Penrose conditions listed in                     I              {\displaystyle I}  . For example, a reflexive inverse is a                     {        1        ,        2        }              {\displaystyle \{1,2\}}  -inverse, a right-inverse is a                     {        1        ,        2        ,        3        }              {\displaystyle \{1,2,3\}}  -inverse, a left-inverse is a                     {        1        ,        2        ,        4        }              {\displaystyle \{1,2,4\}}  -inverse, and a pseudoinverse is a                     {        1        ,        2        ,        3        ,        4        }              {\displaystyle \{1,2,3,4\}}  -inverse. Much research has been devoted to the study between these different classes of generalized inverses; many such results can be found from reference. An example of such a result is the following:                              A                      (            1            ,            4            )                          A                  A                      (            1            ,            3            )                          =                  A                      +                                {\displaystyle A^{(1,4)}AA^{(1,3)}=A^{+}}  for any                     {        1        ,        4        }              {\displaystyle \{1,4\}}  -inverse                               A                      (            1            ,            4            )                                {\displaystyle A^{(1,4)}}  and                     {        1        ,        3        }              {\displaystyle \{1,3\}}  -inverse                               A                      (            1            ,            3            )                                {\displaystyle A^{(1,3)}}  . In particular,                               A                      +                          A                  A                      (            1            ,            3            )                          =                  A                      +                                {\displaystyle A^{+}AA^{(1,3)}=A^{+}}  for any                     {        1        ,        3        }              {\displaystyle \{1,3\}}  -inverse                               A                      (            1            ,            3            )                                {\displaystyle A^{(1,3)}}  .The section on generalized inverses of matrices provides explicit characterizations for the different classes. Generalized inverses of matrices The generalized inverses of matrices can be characterized as follows. Let                     A        ∈                              R                                m            ×            n                                {\displaystyle A\in \mathbb {R} ^{m\times n}}  , and  be its singular-value decomposition. Then for any generalized inverse                               A                      g                                {\displaystyle A^{g}}  , there exist matrices                     X              {\displaystyle X}  ,                     Y              {\displaystyle Y}  , and                     Z              {\displaystyle Z}   such thatConversely, any choice of                     X              {\displaystyle X}  ,                     Y              {\displaystyle Y}  , and                     Z              {\displaystyle Z}   for matrix of this form is a generalized inverse of                     A              {\displaystyle A}  . The                     {        1        ,        2        }              {\displaystyle \{1,2\}}  -inverses are exactly those for which                     Z        =        Y                  Σ                      1                          X              {\displaystyle Z=Y\Sigma _{1}X}  , the                     {        1        ,        3        }              {\displaystyle \{1,3\}}  -inverses are exactly those for which                     X        =        0              {\displaystyle X=0}  , and the                     {        1        ,        4        }              {\displaystyle \{1,4\}}  -inverses are exactly those for which                     Y        =        0              {\displaystyle Y=0}  . In particular, the pseudoinverse is given by                     X        =        Y        =        Z        =        0              {\displaystyle X=Y=Z=0}  : Transformation consistency properties In practical applications it is necessary to identify the class of matrix transformations that must be preserved by a generalized inverse. For example, the Moore–Penrose inverse,                               A                      +                          ,              {\displaystyle A^{+},}   satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to transformations involving unitary matrices U and V:                    (        U        A        V                  )                      +                          =                  V                      ∗                                    A                      +                                    U                      ∗                                {\displaystyle (UAV)^{+}=V^{*}A^{+}U^{*}}  .The Drazin inverse,                               A                                    D                                            {\displaystyle A^{\mathrm {D} }}   satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to similarity transformations involving a nonsingular matrix S:                                          (                          S              A                              S                                  −                  1                                                      )                                              D                                      =        S                  A                                    D                                                S                      −            1                                {\displaystyle \left(SAS^{-1}\right)^{\mathrm {D} }=SA^{\mathrm {D} }S^{-1}}  .The unit-consistent (UC) inverse,                               A                                    U                                      ,              {\displaystyle A^{\mathrm {U} },}   satisfies the following definition of consistency with respect to transformations involving nonsingular diagonal matrices D and E:                    (        D        A        E                  )                                    U                                      =                  E                      −            1                                    A                                    U                                                D                      −            1                                {\displaystyle (DAE)^{\mathrm {U} }=E^{-1}A^{\mathrm {U} }D^{-1}}  .The fact that the Moore–Penrose inverse provides consistency with respect to rotations (which are orthonormal transformations) explains its widespread use in physics and other applications in which Euclidean distances must be preserved. The UC inverse, by contrast, is applicable when system behavior is expected to be invariant with respect to the choice of units on different state variables, e.g., miles versus kilometers.
