In mathematics, convex geometry is the branch of geometry studying convex sets, mainly in Euclidean space. Convex sets occur naturally in many areas: computational geometry, convex analysis, discrete geometry, functional analysis, geometry of numbers, integral geometry, linear programming, probability theory, game theory, etc. Classification According to the Mathematics Subject Classification MSC2010, the mathematical discipline Convex and Discrete Geometry includes three major branches:general convexitypolytopes and polyhedradiscrete geometry(though only portions of the latter two are included in convex geometry).General convexity is further subdivided as follows:axiomatic and generalized convexityconvex sets without dimension restrictionsconvex sets in topological vector spacesconvex sets in 2 dimensions (including convex curves)convex sets in 3 dimensions (including convex surfaces)convex sets in n dimensions (including convex hypersurfaces)finite-dimensional Banach spacesrandom convex sets and integral geometryasymptotic theory of convex bodiesapproximation by convex setsvariants of convex sets (star-shaped, (m, n)-convex, etc.)Helly-type theorems and geometric transversal theoryother problems of combinatorial convexitylength, area, volumemixed volumes and related topicsvaluations on convex bodiesinequalities and extremum problemsconvex functions and convex programsspherical and hyperbolic convexityThe term convex geometry is also used in combinatorics as an alternate name for an antimatroid, which is one of the abstract models of convex sets. Historical note Convex geometry is a relatively young mathematical discipline. Although the first known contributions to convex geometry date back to antiquity and can be traced in the works of Euclid and Archimedes, it became an  independent branch of mathematics at the turn of the 20th century, mainly due to the works of Hermann Brunn and Hermann Minkowski in dimensions two and three. A big part of their results was soon generalized to spaces of higher dimensions, and in 1934 T. Bonnesen and W. Fenchel gave a comprehensive survey of convex geometry in Euclidean space Rn. Further development of convex geometry in the 20th century and its relations to numerous mathematical disciplines are summarized in the Handbook of convex geometry edited by P. M. Gruber and J. M. Wills. See also List of convexity topics Notes  References Expository articles on convex geometry K.
