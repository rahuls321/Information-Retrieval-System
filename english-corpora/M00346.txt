In mathematics, the kernel of a linear map, also known as the null space or nullspace, is the linear subspace of the domain of the map which is mapped to the zero vector. That is, given a linear map L : V → W between two vector spaces V and W, the kernel of L is the vector space of all elements v of V such that L(v) = 0, where 0 denotes the zero vector in W, or more symbolically:                    ker        ⁡        (        L        )        =                  {                                    v                        ∈            V            ∣            L            (                          v                        )            =                          0                                }                .              {\displaystyle \ker(L)=\left\{\mathbf {v} \in V\mid L(\mathbf {v} )=\mathbf {0} \right\}.}   Properties The kernel of L is a linear subspace of the domain V.In the linear map                     L        :        V        →        W        ,              {\displaystyle L:V\to W,}   two elements of V have the same image in W if and only if their difference lies in the kernel of L, that is,From this, it follows that the image of L is isomorphic to the quotient of V by the kernel:In the case where V is finite-dimensional, this implies the rank–nullity theorem:where the term rank refers the dimension of the image of L,                     dim        ⁡        (        im        ⁡        L        )        ,              {\displaystyle \dim(\operatorname {im} L),}   while nullity refers to the dimension of the kernel of L,                     dim        ⁡        (        ker        ⁡        L        )        .              {\displaystyle \dim(\ker L).}   That is,so that the rank–nullity theorem can be restated as When V is an inner product space, the quotient                     V                  /                ker        ⁡        (        L        )              {\displaystyle V/\ker(L)}   can be identified with the orthogonal complement in V of                     ker        ⁡        (        L        )              {\displaystyle \ker(L)}    This is the generalization to linear operators of the row space, or coimage, of a matrix. Application to modules The notion of kernel also makes sense for homomorphisms of modules, which are generalizations of vector spaces where the scalars are elements of a ring, rather than a field. The domain of the mapping is a module, with the kernel constituting a submodule. Here, the concepts of rank and nullity do not necessarily apply. In functional analysis If V and W are topological vector spaces such that W is finite-dimensional, then a linear operator L: V → W is continuous if and only if the kernel of L is a closed subspace of V. Representation as matrix multiplication Consider a linear map represented as a m × n matrix A with coefficients in a field K (typically                               R                      {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }   or                               C                      {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }  ), that is operating on column vectors x with n components over K.The kernel of this linear map is the set of solutions to the equation Ax = 0, where 0 is understood as the zero vector. The dimension of the kernel of A is called the nullity of A.

That is, the kernel of A, the set Null(A), has the following three properties:Null(A) always contains the zero vector, since A0 = 0.If x ∈ Null(A) and y ∈ Null(A), then x + y ∈ Null(A). This follows from the distributivity of matrix multiplication over addition.If x ∈ Null(A) and c is a scalar c ∈ K, then cx ∈ Null(A), since A(cx) = c(Ax) = c0 = 0.= The row space of a matrix =The product Ax can be written in terms of the dot product of vectors as follows:                    A                  x                =                              [                                                                                                      a                                                              1                                                        ⋅                                      x                                                                                                                                          a                                                              2                                                        ⋅                                      x                                                                                                ⋮                                                                                                                        a                                                              m                                                        ⋅                                      x                                                                        ]                          .              {\displaystyle A\mathbf {x} ={\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf {a} _{1}\cdot \mathbf {x} \\\mathbf {a} _{2}\cdot \mathbf {x} \\\vdots \\\mathbf {a} _{m}\cdot \mathbf {x} \end{bmatrix}}.}  Here, a1, ... , am denote the rows of the matrix A. It follows that x is in the kernel of A, if and only if x is orthogonal (or perpendicular) to each of the row vectors of A (since orthogonality is defined as having a dot product of 0).The row space, or coimage, of a matrix A is the span of the row vectors of A. By the above reasoning, the kernel of A is the orthogonal complement to the row space. That is, a vector x lies in the kernel of A, if and only if it is perpendicular to every vector in the row space of A.The dimension of the row space of A is called the rank of A, and the dimension of the kernel of A is called the nullity of A.

The left null space of A is the same as the kernel of AT. The left null space of A is the orthogonal complement to the column space of A, and is dual to the cokernel of the associated linear transformation. The kernel, the row space, the column space, and the left null space of A are the four fundamental subspaces associated to the matrix A.= Nonhomogeneous systems of linear equations =The kernel also plays a role in the solution to a nonhomogeneous system of linear equations:                    A                  x                =                  b                                  or

Computation by Gaussian elimination A basis of the kernel of a matrix may be computed by Gaussian elimination.For this purpose, given an m × n matrix A, we construct first the row augmented matrix                                           [                                                            A                                                                              I                                                      ]                          ,              {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}A\\\hline I\end{bmatrix}},}   where I is the n × n identity matrix.Computing its column echelon form by Gaussian elimination (or any other suitable method), we get a matrix                                           [                                                            B                                                                              C                                                      ]                          .              {\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}B\\\hline C\end{bmatrix}}.}   A basis of the kernel of A consists in the non-zero columns of C such that the corresponding column of B is a zero column.In fact, the computation may be stopped as soon as the upper matrix is in column echelon form: the remainder of the computation consists in changing the basis of the vector space generated by the columns whose upper part is zero.For example, suppose that

It is even more efficient to use modular arithmetic and Chinese remainder theorem, which reduces the problem to several similar ones over finite fields (this avoids the overhead induced by the non-linearity of the computational complexity of integer multiplication).For coefficients in a finite field, Gaussian elimination works well, but for the large matrices that occur in cryptography and Gröbner basis computation, better algorithms are known, which have roughly the same computational complexity, but are faster and behave better with modern computer hardware.= Floating point computation =For matrices whose entries are floating-point numbers, the problem of computing the kernel makes sense only for matrices such that the number of rows is equal to their rank: because of the rounding errors, a floating-point matrix has almost always a full rank, even when it is an approximation of a matrix of a much smaller rank. Even for a full-rank matrix, it is possible to compute its kernel only if it is well conditioned, i.e. it has a low condition number.Even for a well conditioned full rank matrix, Gaussian elimination does not behave correctly: it introduces rounding errors that are too large for getting a significant result. As the computation of the kernel of a matrix is a special instance of solving a homogeneous system of linear equations, the kernel may be computed by any of the various algorithms designed to solve homogeneous systems. A state of the art software for this purpose is the Lapack library.
