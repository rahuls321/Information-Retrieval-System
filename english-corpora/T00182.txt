Hundreds of Empire ships were employed by the Government of the United Kingdom. They were acquired from a number of sources: many were built for the government; others obtained from the United States; still others were captured or seized from enemy powers. Empire ships were mostly used during World War II by the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT), which owned the ships but contracted out their management to various shipping lines; however, some ships requisitioned during the Suez Crisis were also named as Empire ships. Most Empire ships have since been lost or scrapped; however a few still remain in active service or preserved.

Intended to be renamed Balea but on 2 August 1946 exploded and caught fire while discharging aviation fuel in Haifa Roads. HMS Venus and HMS Virago assisted in the rescue. Admiralty discounted a theory that the explosion was caused by a depth charge dropped by a British destroyer to prevent Haganah divers from fixing limpet mines to ships.
Captain John Banks, in charge of Empire Cross at the time, was on her bridge and saw the activity on the two naval ships indicating personnel were aware of frogmen in the water around them, which was probably Haganah trying to attach limpet mines, and he noted the sound of depth charges being dropped into the harbour around the ships. Aviation fuel is very volatile, and its transfer ashore from a tanker is very hazardous. At the inquest, the page from the day's activities was missing from the logbook of the suspect naval ship, Virago. 25 of the crew were lost when the ship exploded into flames. Those whose bodies were found were buried in Haifa. Captain Banks signalled to abandon ship when he saw the line go, and dived overboard, swimming under the flames until he lost consciousness but was rescued by Haganah members.
