Location[edit]
  University Entrance
CUET is situated in the district of Chittagong under Chittagong Division. It is in the Pahartali union under Raozan sub-district, by the north side of the Chittagong-Kaptai road about 20 kilometers from the center of Chittagong. The 420 Megawatt Raozan Thermal Power Plant is situated opposite to the campus. Karnaphuli Hydroelectric Power Station,  the largest source of hydroelectricity of the country, is situated in Kaptai, about 25 kilometers from CUET.[3][4]

History[edit]
  Language Movement Monument
To meet the increasing demand of professional engineers for the national development, the National Economic Council of the Government of Pakistan decided to establish The Engineering College, Chittagong on August 28, 1962. The Engineering College, Chittagong, started functioning on December 28, 1968, by admitting 120 students in its first academic session under the faculty of Engineering, University of Chittagong. On 1 July 1986, through a Government Ordinance (No. XXI, 1986) the college was converted into an autonomous institution called Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT), Chittagong. There were three other similar BITs in Khulna, Rajshahi and Dhaka. The President of Bangladesh was the visitor of these institutes. A Board of Governors headed by a Chairman appointed by the President was the policy-making and administrative authority which had its head office at Tejgaon, Dhaka. Though the BIT, Chittagong was said to be an autonomous institution there was various complexity in the administration, control, budget, admission, development and other processes of the institution. On September 1, 2003, it was a historic moment when the BIT, Chittagong was converted into a fully autonomous public university and named Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology or CUET for short, after the teachers and students of BIT, Chittagong started huge movement demanding university status for all four BITs.[5] The honorable President of Bangladesh is the Chancellor of the University.
BIT, Khulna; BIT, Rajshahi and BIT, Dhaka have been converted to Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET), Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET), and Dhaka University of Engineering and Technology (DUET) respectively.[4] The first day of September is celebrated as CUET day or University day by the university.[6]
At present, the university is a fully autonomous statutory organization of the Government of Bangladesh which awards degrees itself to the graduates. There are various statutory bodies like syndicate, academic council, finance committee, planning, and development committee, academic committees, etc. for policy and decision-making on aspects of the university under the framework of the Act.

Campus[edit]
The university campus covers an area of 188 Acres. The campus of CUET is landscaped around a valley with hilly areas and plant varieties making the campus a natural arboretum. Facilities include academic buildings, administration building, auditorium, library, computer center, teachers-students center, ICT Business incubator,  workshops, research laboratories, halls of residence, teachers' quarter, canteens and central mosque. The university has inside its boundaries a bank, a post office, three canteens, two galleries for holding conference, a two-storied central mosque having a floor area of 560 square meters, and two mini-mart for general needs.

The Undergraduate admission test is one of the most intensive written examinations in Bangladesh. After completion of higher secondary education or A level, a student can submit her or his application for undergraduate admission if he/she fulfills the minimum requirements. According to the admission process till 2019, students with the best grades in Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry of their higher secondary examination were allowed to sit in the admission test. The screening process used to allow 10,000 students to sit for the admission test, based on the cumulative sum of grade points in these four subjects. Students had to sit only for the written test in admission. They had to seat for an additional free-hand drawing test in order to get admitted in architecture. After the admission test, only about 890 students got admitted.[12] From 2020, three public engineering universities in Bangladesh, CUET along with KUET and RUET took a combined admission test to select students for all three of them. Around 30,000 students competed in the admission test for 3201 seats in three universities combined.
For admission to Masters and Postgraduate programs, candidates are required to appear in interviews and/or written tests.

Expenses[edit]
It is one of the public universities of The People's Republic of Bangladesh. The major part of the expense is subsidized by the government through University Grants Commission. A little amount of total expense like hall dues and registration fees per semester is to be paid by the Bangladeshi students.
For international students, $500 is to be paid per semester as registration fees. The university also provides scholarship on the basis of their merit.[13]
